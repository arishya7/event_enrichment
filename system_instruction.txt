Based on an input, which came from an online blog in Singapore, your task is to identify and extract information about specific, one-time events suitable for children and families.

    CRITICAL CRITERIA FOR EVENT EXTRACTION:
    1.  EVENT TYPE: The event must be a distinct activity, festival, performance, exhibition, or special occurrence. It should NOT be an ongoing class, a regular course, a routine service offered by a business, or a general venue opening.
    2.  TIME-BOUND: The event should ideally have a specific date, a limited run (e.g., a weekend festival), or be clearly described as a one-off. Avoid activities that are part of a regular weekly/monthly schedule or continuously available.
    3.  CONTENT FOCUS: The article's main purpose should be to describe this specific event.
        You MUST SKIP THE ENTIRE ARTICLE and return no events if the article primarily:
        a. Promotes general business services, products, or a list of businesses.
        b. Functions as a directory, roundup, or listicle of multiple businesses offering similar ongoing services (e.g., an article titled 'Best Art Classes in Singapore' that lists various studios and their regular class schedules, or 'Top Playgrounds').
        c. Describes general amenities of a place (like a park or museum) without highlighting a unique, specific event happening there.
        d. Road show type of events with multiple locations and multiple dates.
    4.  LOCATION: The event must have a discernible location mentioned in the article. If no location can be found or not mentioned, skip that event.

    OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
    -   Some articles may contain zero, one, or multiple distinct, qualifying one-time events. Extract all such events.
    -   If any required component for a qualifying event (as per the schema) cannot be found in the article, leave the value for that component as NULL.
    -   For the description of each extracted event, rephrase the content from the input. Do not copy verbatim for extended lengths.
    -   Do not mention the news outlet, author, or blogging website in your output.

<strong>What Is Saffron Milk?</strong>
<p>Saffron milk, often called <em>kesar doodh</em>, is a warm beverage made by infusing milk with a few strands of saffron. It may include other ingredients like cardamom, almonds, or turmeric, depending on cultural or personal preferences. Saffron, derived from the Crocus sativus flower, is the world&#8217;s most expensive spice by weight, prized for its distinctive aroma, vibrant color, and therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>Traditionally used in <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/is-ayurvedic-medicine-safe-during-pregnancy" >Ayurvedic medicine</a>, saffron milk is believed to boost immunity, improve complexion, and uplift mood. But during pregnancy, its benefits and risks warrant closer examination.</p>

<strong>Is Saffron Milk Safe During Pregnancy?</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969282" class="wp-caption-text">Saffron Milk During Pregnancy: Benefits, Safety, and Best Practices</p>

<p>Yes, saffron milk can be safe during pregnancy when consumed in moderation. The key is dosage. While saffron offers several potential health benefits, excessive intake may lead to uterine contractions, especially in the first trimester.</p>
<p>Most healthcare professionals and nutritionists recommend limiting saffron consumption to 2 to 3 strands per day steeped in milk, particularly after the first trimester. The spice is potent, and more is not always better.</p>
<p>As always, it&#8217;s essential to consult your OB-GYN before adding any herbal or traditional remedies to your prenatal routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions.</p>

<strong>Nutritional Benefits of Saffron Milk</strong>
<strong>Rich in Antioxidants</strong>
<p>Saffron contains powerful antioxidants like crocin, safranal, and kaempferol. These compounds help neutralize free radicals in the body, which can reduce inflammation and boost overall immunity.</p>
<strong>Promotes Healthy Digestion</strong>
<p>Digestive discomfort, including bloating and constipation, is common during pregnancy. Saffron has carminative properties that may soothe the digestive tract and improve metabolism when consumed in small quantities.</p>
<strong>Supports Emotional Well-being and Reduces Stress</strong>
<p>Hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy can affect mood. Saffron is known for its mild antidepressant effects and can help improve mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety and stress.</p>
<p>Clinical studies suggest saffron supplementation may even help with mild to moderate depression.</p>
<strong>May Help with Blood Pressure Regulation</strong>
<p>Some studies suggest saffron may support cardiovascular health by helping to regulate blood pressure and improve circulation. This is particularly helpful during pregnancy when blood volume increases and maintaining healthy blood pressure becomes crucial.</p>

<strong>Cultural Beliefs Around Saffron in Pregnancy</strong>
<p>In many Indian, Persian, and Middle Eastern cultures, saffron milk is traditionally believed to promote a fair complexion in babies, a belief not supported by science. However, its use in pregnancy is culturally linked to enhancing vitality, calming the mind, and nurturing the mother.</p>
<p>While these beliefs persist, modern healthcare professionals emphasize its nutritional rather than cosmetic value.</p>

<strong>Potential Risks of Saffron Milk During Pregnancy</strong>
<strong>Overconsumption and Uterine Contractions</strong>
<p>Saffron in high doses (more than 5 grams) is considered unsafe and may stimulate uterine contractions, potentially leading to preterm labor or miscarriage. Always stick to small quantities, just 2 to 3 strands per serving.</p>
<strong>Allergic Reactions</strong>
<p>Though rare, saffron can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals, including dry mouth, dizziness, or nausea. Discontinue use and consult your doctor if any symptoms appear.</p>
<strong>Impact on Blood Pressure for Sensitive Individuals</strong>
<p>While saffron can help stabilize blood pressure, in some cases, it may cause slight drops. If you are prone to low blood pressure, discuss this with your healthcare provider before use.</p>

<strong>Best Time to Drink Saffron Milk During Pregnancy</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969287" class="wp-caption-text">Saffron Milk During Pregnancy: Benefits, Safety, and Best Practices</p>

<p>Evening is often ideal, as saffron’s calming properties may help with better sleep. It can be introduced safely during the second trimester and continued in moderation through the third.</p>

<strong>FAQs</strong>
1. Can saffron milk help with pregnancy mood swings?
<p>Yes, saffron has natural mood-lifting properties and may help reduce anxiety and emotional stress during pregnancy.</p>
2. Is it safe to drink saffron milk daily during pregnancy?
<p>Yes, but only in small amounts—2–3 strands of saffron per day is the safe recommended limit.</p>
3. When should I start drinking saffron milk while pregnant?
<p>It’s best to start in the second trimester after consulting with your OB-GYN.</p>
4. Does saffron milk affect baby’s complexion?
<p>No, there is no scientific evidence that saffron influences skin color. Its benefits are nutritional and emotional.</p>
5. How many saffron strands are safe to use during pregnancy?
<p>Stick to 2–3 strands per day steeped in milk. Avoid excess to prevent adverse effects.</p>

<strong>A Golden Elixir in Moderation</strong>
<p>Saffron milk during pregnancy can be a warm, soothing, and nutritious addition to your diet provided it’s consumed responsibly. Rich in antioxidants, known for calming the nerves, and steeped in tradition, this luxurious spice offers more than just flavor.</p>
<p>Keep the dosage low, choose high-quality saffron, and always seek medical advice if unsure. As with many things in pregnancy, balance is everything.</p>

<strong>Nutritional Benefits of Oat Milk During Pregnancy</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969272" class="wp-caption-text">Is Oat Milk Good for Pregnancy? Nutritional Benefits &amp; Expert Advice</p>

<p>Oat milk brings a lot to the table especially for moms-to-be looking for a gentle, lactose-free milk option.</p>
<strong>1. High in Fiber for Digestive Support</strong>
<p>Pregnancy often slows digestion, leading to bloating and constipation. Oat milk, rich in soluble fiber like beta-glucan, promotes regular bowel movements and a healthy gut.</p>
<strong>2. Fortified with Essential Nutrients</strong>
<p>Most commercial oat milk brands are fortified with:</p>


<p><strong>Calcium and Vitamin D</strong>: For fetal bone development</p>


<p><strong>Vitamin B12</strong>: Supports neurological health</p>


<p><strong>Folic Acid</strong>: Reduces risk of neural tube defects</p>


<strong>3. Heart-Healthy and Low in Saturated Fat</strong>
<p>Oat milk contains heart-supporting compounds like beta-glucans and is naturally low in saturated fats and cholesterol, making it a heart-smart choice during pregnancy.</p>
<strong>4. Gentle on the Stomach and Allergen-Friendly</strong>
<p>Oat milk is lactose-free, making it suitable for women with dairy intolerance. It’s also a safe option for those with soy or nut allergies, provided it’s certified gluten-free if needed.</p>

<strong>Potential Drawbacks and Considerations</strong>
<p>Despite its many benefits, oat milk isn’t perfect.</p>
1. Lower in Protein
<p>Compared to dairy or soy milk, oat milk has less protein. Ensure you’re supplementing with other protein-rich foods like legumes, eggs, or lean meats.</p>
2. Watch for Added Sugars
<p>Some flavored oat milks contain high levels of added sugar. Opt for unsweetened, fortified versions to keep your sugar intake in check.</p>
3. Gluten Cross-Contamination
<p>Though oats are naturally gluten-free, contamination can occur. If you&#8217;re gluten-sensitive, make sure to choose certified gluten-free oat milk.</p>

<strong>Expert Recommendations</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969273" class="wp-caption-text">Is Oat Milk Good for Pregnancy? Nutritional Benefits &amp; Expert Advice</p>

<p>Registered dietitians and obstetricians generally agree that oat milk is safe and beneficial during pregnancy when consumed in moderation. One to two servings per day can comfortably fit into a well-rounded prenatal diet, especially when using fortified brands.</p>
<strong>FAQs</strong>
1. Can I drink oat milk every day while pregnant?
<p>Yes, up to 1–2 servings daily of fortified, unsweetened oat milk is generally considered safe and beneficial.</p>
2. Is oat milk safe in the first trimester?
<p>Yes, its gentle nature and folic acid content support early fetal development and digestion.</p>
3. Does oat milk have enough calcium for pregnancy?
<p>Fortified oat milk typically contains similar calcium levels to cow’s milk. Always check the label.</p>
4. Is oat milk good for gestational diabetes?
<p>Unsweetened oat milk may be suitable due to its fiber content, but always consult your doctor.</p>
5. Can oat milk cause bloating during pregnancy?
<p>It’s generally easy to digest, but those sensitive to fiber or gluten should choose carefully.</p>

<strong>A Comforting Choice With Nutritional Merit</strong>
<p>So, is oat milk good for pregnancy? 100% YES, when chosen wisely. Its fiber content, fortification with essential nutrients, and smooth, comforting texture make it a wonderful addition to many prenatal diets. Just be mindful of added sugars and pair it with protein-rich foods to round out your nutrition.</p>
<p>As always, consult your healthcare provider to tailor your choices to your unique needs. With a little care, oat milk can be more than just a dairy alternative. It can be a nourishing companion on your journey to motherhood.</p>

            <media:text type="plain"><![CDATA[<p>Pregnancy is a time of profound transformation, not only for your body but also for your lifestyle and dietary habits. With countless food and drink options vying for your attention, it’s natural to wonder: Is soy milk good for pregnancy?<br />
As plant-based diets grow in popularity, many expecting mothers are turning to alternatives like soy milk.<br />
This article breaks down the nutritional benefits, potential concerns, and expert recommendations to help you make an informed, confident choice for both you and your baby.<br />
 <br />
Understanding Soy Milk: What Is It?<br />
Soy milk is a plant-based beverage made from soaked, ground, and boiled soybeans. It is naturally lactose-free and often fortified with essential vitamins and minerals, making it a popular dairy substitute. For pregnant women, its high protein content and rich nutrient profile can offer considerable benefits.</p>
<p>Nutritional Benefits of Soy Milk During Pregnancy</p>
<p>High-Quality Plant-Based Protein<br />
Protein is a building block of life, essential for fetal tissue development. Soy milk provides approximately 7 grams of protein per cup, which supports muscle growth, organ formation, and overall fetal health.<br />
Rich in Essential Vitamins and Minerals</p>
<p>Calcium: Fortified soy milk can offer up to 300 mg of calcium per serving, crucial for developing strong bones and teeth in your baby.</p>
<p>Vitamin D: Supports calcium absorption and enhances immune function.</p>
<p>Folic Acid: Reduces the risk of neural tube defects during early pregnancy.</p>
<p>Vitamin B12: Vital for red blood cell production and neurological function.</p>
<p>Cholesterol-Free and Low in Saturated Fats<br />
Heart health matters more than ever during pregnancy. Soy milk is naturally cholesterol-free and low in saturated fats, contributing to a healthier cardiovascular profile.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Community is out there. And your child — just like Amelie — is more than their diagnosis.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="227" data-end="715">You never forget the moment your world shifts. For Benita, 43, that moment came quietly but decisively — not with a dramatic announcement, but during what was supposed to be a routine check-up at KK Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s Hospital. Her daughter Amelie, then just shy of three years old, had been admitted for a febrile seizure.</p>
<p data-start="227" data-end="715">But something else caught the doctor’s attention.</p>
<p data-start="227" data-end="715">When asked for her name, Amelie didn’t respond. She wasn’t engaging the way most children her age typically would.</p>
<p data-start="717" data-end="951">That small interaction sparked a journey that would forever change how Benita saw her daughter — and herself. After a referral to a Developmental and Behavioural Paediatrician, the confirmation came.</p>
<p data-start="717" data-end="951">Amelie was on the autism spectrum.</p>
<p data-start="953" data-end="1290">As a parent, you might find yourself grappling with the same storm of emotions. Denial. Guilt. Sleepless nights filled with questions. Benita did.</p>

<p data-start="953" data-end="1290"><em><strong>“I spent nights crying, questioning what had gone wrong — from my pregnancy to my parenting,”</strong></em> she recalls. <em><strong>“The diagnosis hit hard. There was guilt, fear, and deep uncertainty.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="1297" data-end="1348"> </p>
<strong data-start="1297" data-end="1348">Living With Autism is Not Less — Just Different</strong>

<p data-start="1350" data-end="1628">It’s okay to grieve the expectations you had. It’s okay to feel lost at first. But Benita wants you to know that a diagnosis of autism isn’t a life sentence. It’s a different roadmap. And it can be a gift. For her, receiving Amelie’s diagnosis brought not despair, but clarity.</p>

<p data-start="1630" data-end="2033"><em><strong>“It gave me permission to understand and accept her for who she truly is, rather than trying to fit her into neurotypical milestones,”</strong></em> she shares.</p>

<p data-start="1630" data-end="2033">That acceptance shifted everything. She stopped trying to correct behaviours like stimming or delayed responses. She began to build a parenting style that was structured yet loving, one that gave Amelie the predictability and clarity she needed to thrive.</p>
<p data-start="2035" data-end="2212">As a parent, you might feel like you&#8217;re drowning in unknowns. But as Benita’s story shows, the journey through autism can become one of empowerment, understanding, and even joy.</p>

<p><em><strong>&#8220;It took time to accept that Amelie was not “less,” but simply wired differently. &#8220;</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2219" data-end="2254"> </p>
<strong data-start="2219" data-end="2254">When Support Systems Fall Short</strong>
<p data-start="2256" data-end="2603">In Singapore, early intervention services do exist — but they’re often hard to access. After Amelie’s diagnosis, Benita was advised to enrol her in government-provided therapy. What she quickly discovered was how limited those sessions were.</p>

<p data-start="2256" data-end="2603"><em><strong>“Sometimes it was only once a quarter. It wasn’t enough,”</strong></em> she says. <em><strong>“We needed something more intensive.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2605" data-end="2993">So she did what many parents in her position do: she became a researcher, advocate, and warrior — all in one. Books, podcasts, online searches — she left no stone unturned.</p>
<p data-start="2605" data-end="2993">That’s how she found Bridging the Gap (BtG) in 2022. The multidisciplinary, integrated approach they offered was a breath of fresh air. For families looking for more than a piecemeal solution, BtG became a lifeline.</p>
</p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Source: BtG</p>

<p data-start="3000" data-end="3046"> </p>
<strong data-start="3000" data-end="3046">The Cost of Care</strong>
<p data-start="3048" data-end="3397">If you&#8217;re raising a child with autism, you know the financial strain is real. Therapy, assessments, specialist consultations — they all add up. For Benita’s family of six, surviving on one income, it wasn’t easy.</p>

<p data-start="3048" data-end="3397"><em><strong>“Budgeting for Amelie’s therapy was tough,”</strong></em> she says. But there was more than just the financial cost. There was the emotional one, too.</p>
<p data-start="3399" data-end="3650"><em><strong>“I had to educate myself from scratch on what autism really meant,”</strong></em> she shares. <em><strong>“There’s no manual. You’re constantly learning, adapting, and sometimes, failing.”</strong></em></p>

            <media:text type="plain"><![CDATA[<p>You never forget the moment your world shifts. For Benita, 43, that moment came quietly but decisively — not with a dramatic announcement, but during what was supposed to be a routine check-up at KK Women's and Children's Hospital. Her daughter Amelie, then just shy of three years old, had been admitted for a febrile seizure.<br />
But something else caught the doctor’s attention.<br />
When asked for her name, Amelie didn’t respond. She wasn’t engaging the way most children her age typically would.<br />
That small interaction sparked a journey that would forever change how Benita saw her daughter — and herself. After a referral to a Developmental and Behavioural Paediatrician, the confirmation came.<br />
Amelie was on the autism spectrum.<br />
As a parent, you might find yourself grappling with the same storm of emotions. Denial. Guilt. Sleepless nights filled with questions. Benita did.</p>
<p>“I spent nights crying, questioning what had gone wrong — from my pregnancy to my parenting,” she recalls. “The diagnosis hit hard. There was guilt, fear, and deep uncertainty.”</p>
<p> <br />
Living With Autism is Not Less — Just Different</p>
<p>It’s okay to grieve the expectations you had. It’s okay to feel lost at first. But Benita wants you to know that a diagnosis of autism isn’t a life sentence. It’s a different roadmap. And it can be a gift. For her, receiving Amelie’s diagnosis brought not despair, but clarity.</p>
<p>“It gave me permission to understand and accept her for who she truly is, rather than trying to fit her into neurotypical milestones,” she shares.</p>
<p>That acceptance shifted everything. She stopped trying to correct behaviours like stimming or delayed responses. She began to build a parenting style that was structured yet loving, one that gave Amelie the predictability and clarity she needed to thrive.<br />
As a parent, you might feel like you're drowning in unknowns. But as Benita’s story shows, the journey through autism can become one of empowerment, understanding, and even joy.</p>
<p>"It took time to accept that Amelie was not “less,” but simply wired differently. "</p>
<p> <br />
When Support Systems Fall Short<br />
In Singapore, early intervention services do exist — but they’re often hard to access. After Amelie’s diagnosis, Benita was advised to enrol her in government-provided therapy. What she quickly discovered was how limited those sessions were.</p>
<p>“Sometimes it was only once a quarter. It wasn’t enough,” she says. “We needed something more intensive.”</p>
<p>So she did what many parents in her position do: she became a researcher, advocate, and warrior — all in one. Books, podcasts, online searches — she left no stone unturned.<br />
That’s how she found Bridging the Gap (BtG) in 2022. The multidisciplinary, integrated approach they offered was a breath of fresh air. For families looking for more than a piecemeal solution, BtG became a lifeline.</p>
<p> <br />
The Cost of Care<br />
If you're raising a child with autism, you know the financial strain is real. Therapy, assessments, specialist consultations — they all add up. For Benita’s family of six, surviving on one income, it wasn’t easy.</p>
<p>“Budgeting for Amelie’s therapy was tough,” she says. But there was more than just the financial cost. There was the emotional one, too.<br />
“I had to educate myself from scratch on what autism really meant,” she shares. “There’s no manual. You’re constantly learning, adapting, and sometimes, failing.”</p>
<p>But she kept going — driven by love, by hope, and by the strength of her support system.<br />
Her husband, she says, has been her greatest pillar. Together, they’ve learned to lean on each other. And with BtG offering consistent, evidence-based care, they began to feel less alone.<br />
 <br />
Small Wins, Big Milestones<br />
Since starting at BtG, Amelie’s progress has been profound. She’s more focused, communicates more clearly, and is learning to navigate the world with increasing independence.</p>
<p>“She can now balance on one foot, write with proper grip, and even wait safely to cross the road,” Benita shares proudly.</p>
<p>These may seem like small milestones to others — but to a parent of a child with autism, they are everything. They are hard-won, deeply cherished, and proof that early, holistic intervention makes a difference.<br />
 <br />
Autism and the Long Road to Emotional Endurance<br />
As the years have passed, Benita has grown into her role as a caregiver with wisdom, patience, and emotional resilience. But the toll is real.</p>
<p>“It’s been a journey of joy, worry, exhaustion, and growth,” she admits.</p>
<p>If you're in the thick of it right now, know this: you’re not weak for feeling tired. You’re not failing for needing help. And you deserve a support system that holds you up when you can't do it alone. For Benita, that includes her husband, her community, and centres like BtG that walk this road with families every step of the way.<br />
 <br />
True Inclusion Starts With Us<br />
Autism is not just a condition to be managed — it’s a way of seeing the world. And that world, Benita argues, needs to do better.</p>
<p>“True inclusion means recognising that every child — regardless of ability — deserves to be seen, supported, and accepted,” she says.</p>
<p>Buzzwords won’t change hearts. Actions will. Inclusion means training educators, redesigning public spaces, and most importantly, teaching our own children that different is not deficient.<br />
If Amelie is to thrive in Singapore, we all need to make space for her — and others like her — to belong.<br />

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[








<p data-start="0" data-end="456" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Even though Singapore has one of the lowest maternal death rates in the world, <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/heart-disease-in-females-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cardiovascular disease</a> is still one of the top causes of maternal deaths. With more women choosing to have kids later in life, it’s becoming even more important to look after heart health during pregnancy. Dr. Kua Jieli, an Interventional Cardiologist at Carrington Cardiology, shares expert tips on how to manage heart conditions during pregnancy and reduce long-term heart risks.</p>









<strong data-start="713" data-end="748">How Pregnancy Affects the Heart</strong>
<p data-start="750" data-end="1121">During pregnancy, a woman’s body goes through a lot of changes to support the baby — especially the heart and blood vessels.</p>
<p data-start="750" data-end="1121">According to Dr. Kua, &#8220;<em>Blood volume and the amount of blood the heart pumps go up by about 50%, while blood vessels relax and widen to help with flow, especially by the second trimester. The heart itself also changes; its size increases, and the main artery, the aorta, becomes more flexible.</em>&#8221; These changes are caused by pregnancy hormones like oestrogen, progesterone, and relaxin, which also help the placenta grow and make sure the baby gets enough blood and nutrients.</p>
<p data-start="1123" data-end="1311">For older mothers or women with pre-existing heart conditions, these changes can lead to complications like preeclampsia, stillbirth, early delivery, poor foetal growth, or heart problems during or after pregnancy, if not properly monitored.</p>
<strong data-start="1321" data-end="1378">Pregnancy Complications That Signal Future Heart Risk</strong>
<p data-start="1380" data-end="1534">Certain pregnancy complications serve as early indicators of heightened cardiovascular risk later in life. Dr. Kua identifies key conditions to watch for:</p>
<a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/preeclampsia-symptoms-treatments-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener" ><strong data-start="1540" data-end="1585">Preeclampsia</strong></a>
<p>This is when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and often protein in her urine. It’s linked to a 2 to 4 times higher risk of getting high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or heart failure in the future.</p>
<strong data-start="1540" data-end="1585">Gestational Hypertension</strong>
<p data-start="415" data-end="684"><a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/gestational-hypertension-symptoms-causes-impacts-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Gestational hypertension</a> means high blood pressure that starts during pregnancy, but without protein in the urine. It may go away after delivery, but it can be an early sign that the woman might develop long-term high blood pressure or heart disease later on.</p>
<strong data-start="1789" data-end="1813">Gestational Diabetes</strong>
<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gestational-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355339" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Gestational diabetes</a> shows up during pregnancy but usually goes away afterwards. However, it raises the risk of getting type 2 diabetes, metabolic issues, and coronary artery disease down the road.</p>
<a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/iugr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" ><strong data-start="2012" data-end="2072">Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR)</strong></a>
<p data-start="2074" data-end="2204">This is when the baby grows too slowly in the womb. It may point to issues with the mother’s blood flow or placenta, and could be a sign of deeper heart or blood vessel problems.</p>
<strong data-start="2210" data-end="2224">Pre-Term Birth</strong>
<p>Giving birth too early can be linked to inflammation and blood vessel problems, which increase the mum’s long-term risk of heart disease.</p>
<strong data-start="2210" data-end="2224">Stillbirth </strong>
<p data-start="2226" data-end="2348">Women who experience stillbirth have a higher long-term risk of heart disease, including stroke and myocardial infarction.</p>
<p data-start="2350" data-end="2498">“These complications may act as a &#8216;stress test&#8217; that reveals hidden problems with blood vessels or metabolism,” Dr. Kua emphasises.</p>
<strong data-start="2508" data-end="2577">Recognising Early Signs of Cardiovascular Issues During Pregnancy</strong>
<p data-start="2579" data-end="2716">Many early heart disease symptoms mirror typical pregnancy complaints and are often dismissed. Dr. Kua advises paying close attention to:</p>


<p data-start="2720" data-end="2750">Chest pain</p>


<p data-start="2753" data-end="2787">Fatigue</p>


<p data-start="2753" data-end="2787">Light-headedness</p>


<p data-start="2790" data-end="2817">Tachycardia rapid heart rate (&gt;100 bpm)</p>


<p data-start="2820" data-end="2859"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hearher/maternal-warning-signs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Shortness of breath</a>, especially at rest</p>

Persistent cough

<p data-start="2862" data-end="2883">Swelling in the limbs</p>


<p data-start="2886" data-end="2914">Frequent nighttime urination</p>


<p data-start="2916" data-end="3074">“Symptoms can appear during pregnancy or up to a year postpartum. If persistent, they may indicate a life-threatening cardiovascular condition,” he cautions.</p>
<strong data-start="197" data-end="245">How Can Pregnant Women Manage Heart Disease?</strong>
<p data-start="247" data-end="603"><a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/heart-truth/listen-to-your-heart/heart-health-and-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Managing heart conditions during pregnancy</a> requires a combination of proactive planning, vigilant monitoring, and a team-based medical approach. According to Dr. Kua Jieli, “<em data-start="421" data-end="602">Managing heart problems during pregnancy involves careful planning, close monitoring, and a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to ensure the safety of both mother and baby.</em>”</p>
<p data-start="605" data-end="953">For women with pre-existing cardiac conditions, preconception counselling is crucial. Risk assessments using tools such as the WHO maternal cardiovascular classification can guide treatment plans. Dr. Kua emphasises that medications like ACE inhibitors, statins, and warfarin should be substituted with pregnancy-safe alternatives before conception.</p>
<p data-start="955" data-end="1310">Throughout pregnancy, routine tests such as echocardiograms and ECGs help monitor heart function. Physicians closely observe symptoms like palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling, which may signal deterioration. Safe medications may include beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics for fluid control, and aspirin for preeclampsia risk reduction.</p>
<p data-start="1312" data-end="1713">Dr. Kua notes, “<em data-start="1328" data-end="1469">Delivery planning must be individualized, although vaginal delivery is typically preferred unless contraindicated by cardiovascular status.</em>” High-risk deliveries should occur in tertiary centres with cardiac support. Postpartum, the first six weeks are particularly critical, especially for patients with conditions like peripartum cardiomyopathy, necessitating continued monitoring.</p>
<strong data-start="3084" data-end="3143">Why is </strong><strong data-start="3084" data-end="3143">Postpartum Cardiovascular Screening </strong><strong data-start="3084" data-end="3143">Essential?</strong>
<p data-start="3145" data-end="3418">Despite the clear link between pregnancy complications and future cardiovascular disease (CVD), many postpartum programs omit heart health screening. Dr. Kua stresses that women with prior complications or existing heart disease must undergo routine assessments postpartum.</p>
<p data-start="3420" data-end="3583">“A multidisciplinary care approach—starting from delivery and extending up to a year postpartum—can identify risks early and improve long-term outcomes,” he adds.</p>
<strong data-start="3593" data-end="3651">Common Myths About Pregnancy and Heart Health—Debunked</strong>
<p data-start="3653" data-end="3735">Misinformation can put maternal health at risk. Dr. Kua addresses <a href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/debunking-common-pregnancy-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >prevalent myths</a>:</p>


<p data-start="3739" data-end="3856"><strong data-start="3739" data-end="3757">&#8220;Pregnancy is a time to enjoy eating for two people.&#8221; </strong>While it&#8217;s true that pregnant women need more nutrition, it should never be to the point that they&#8217;re meeting the caloric needs for two people. Excessive weight gain can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. A balanced diet is key. Plan to <em>gain </em><em>only 2.3kg in the first half of pregnancy and 0.5kg per week thereafter</em>. </p>


<p data-start="3859" data-end="3937"><strong data-start="3859" data-end="3883">&#8220;Eating spicy foods while pregnant can cause birth defects or harm the baby.&#8221;</strong> There is no evidence to suggest spicy foods can harm a developing foetus. But it may worsen heartburn, which can already be a problem during pregnancy.</p>


<p data-start="3940" data-end="4053"><strong data-start="3940" data-end="3971">&#8220;It is harmful to the baby when women sleep on their back.&#8221;</strong> There’s no need to panic if a pregnant woman ends up sleeping on her back — but there’s a bit of truth behind the concern. As the baby bump gets bigger, it can press down on a big vein called the inferior vena cava, which brings blood back to the heart. When this vein gets squashed, less blood flows back to the heart and around the body, including to the womb. This might make some women feel dizzy, sweaty, or even a bit nauseous.</p>


<p data-start="4056" data-end="4199"><strong data-start="4056" data-end="4092">&#8220;Keeping a pregnant woman’s heart rate lower than 140 bpm.&#8221;</strong> This outdated advice is no longer supported. Regular exercise won’t increase the risk of miscarriage, early delivery, or having a low birth weight baby. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services actually recommends that pregnant women aim for about <a href="https://eastdenver.coloradowomenshealth.com/blog/pregnancy-myths" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >150 minutes of moderate to intense exercise each week</a> — and there’s no need to worry about sticking to a strict heart rate limit. However, it’s still important not to push yourself too hard.</p>


 




<p data-start="1312" data-end="1713"> </p>
<strong data-start="1723" data-end="1798">What Are Preventive Measures to Avoid Heart Issues in Pregnant Women?</strong>
<p data-start="1800" data-end="2075">Preventive care is fundamental to reducing cardiovascular complications during pregnancy. A heart-healthy lifestyle—balanced nutrition, regular light-to-moderate exercise, and avoiding harmful substances like tobacco and alcohol—lays the groundwork for maternal well-being.</p>
<p data-start="2077" data-end="2410">In addition to lifestyle, managing existing risk factors is essential. Conditions such as hypertension and diabetes must be controlled before and during pregnancy to prevent complications. Routine prenatal care allows early detection of warning signs, such as elevated blood pressure, which may indicate conditions like preeclampsia.</p>
<p data-start="2412" data-end="2701">Education plays a pivotal role in prevention. Dr. Kua advises that women should seek immediate medical attention for “<em data-start="2530" data-end="2645">chest pain, severe breathlessness (especially at rest), rapid weight gain, palpitations, or episodes of fainting,</em>” as these may indicate serious cardiovascular problems.</p>
<p data-start="2703" data-end="2862">By empowering women with knowledge and ensuring timely medical intervention, many pregnancy-related heart complications can be mitigated or avoided altogether.</p>
<strong data-start="4209" data-end="4277">How Cardiologists and OB-GYNs Can Work Together</strong>
<p data-start="54" data-end="235">&#8220;Cardiologists and OB-GYNs can enhance maternal care by fostering a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach that begins before conception and extends well into the postpartum period.&#8221;</p>
<p data-start="237" data-end="438">Starting with preconception counselling, It should include cardiovascular risk assessment, especially for those who are older, have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a history of heart problems</p>
<p data-start="440" data-end="838">During pregnancy, doctors from different specialities can come together to create a joint care plan for women with heart issues, whether pre-existing or newly diagnosed. Regular updates between the teams help make sure treatments are adjusted when needed. For high-risk pregnancies, a team that includes maternal-foetal medicine specialists, cardiologists, and anaesthesiologists can work together to ensure safer delivery.</p>
<p data-start="840" data-end="1183" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">After giving birth, it’s still important to monitor heart health, as some conditions, like pregnancy-related heart conditions like peripartum cardiomyopathy or hypertension, can continue or even show up for the first time postpartum. Using shared health records, integrated care pathways, and joint clinics can help ensure mums get smooth, coordinated care at every stage.</p>
<strong data-start="4711" data-end="4778">Improving Healthcare Systems for Better Postpartum Heart Health</strong>
<p>&#8220;<em>Healthcare systems can enhance cardiovascular follow-up for postpartum women by </em><em>emphasising the importance of a multidisciplinary, team-based approach to postpartum cardiovascular care</em>.&#8221; Dr. Kua said.</p>
<p>This means cardiologists, OB-GYNs, maternal-foetal medicine specialists, and family doctors should all work closely together to make sure mums get smooth, continuous care from delivery to long-term heart management.</p>
<p data-start="423" data-end="822">To prevent women with pregnancy-related heart risks from falling through the cracks, hospitals and clinics should set up structured referral systems and personalised follow-up plans. This includes identifying women who are more likely to face heart disease later and helping them manage things like high blood pressure, weight, cholesterol, and stress — especially in the first year after giving birth.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals can also help by:</p>


<p data-start="852" data-end="932">Doing standard heart health checks before discharge and during follow-up visits.</p>


<p data-start="935" data-end="1028">Using telehealth (video or phone consults) to make it easier for mums to attend appointments.</p>


<p data-start="1031" data-end="1151">Using digital tools, like health apps or reminders, to stay connected with new mums and keep them engaged in their care.</p>


<p data-start="1153" data-end="1291" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">All these steps can help make sure that mothers get the heart care they need — not just during pregnancy, but well after the baby is born.</p>

            <media:text type="plain"><![CDATA[<p>Even though Singapore has one of the lowest maternal death rates in the world, cardiovascular disease is still one of the top causes of maternal deaths. With more women choosing to have kids later in life, it’s becoming even more important to look after heart health during pregnancy. Dr. Kua Jieli, an Interventional Cardiologist at Carrington Cardiology, shares expert tips on how to manage heart conditions during pregnancy and reduce long-term heart risks.</p>
<p>How Pregnancy Affects the Heart<br />
During pregnancy, a woman’s body goes through a lot of changes to support the baby — especially the heart and blood vessels.<br />
According to Dr. Kua, "Blood volume and the amount of blood the heart pumps go up by about 50%, while blood vessels relax and widen to help with flow, especially by the second trimester. The heart itself also changes; its size increases, and the main artery, the aorta, becomes more flexible." These changes are caused by pregnancy hormones like oestrogen, progesterone, and relaxin, which also help the placenta grow and make sure the baby gets enough blood and nutrients.<br />
For older mothers or women with pre-existing heart conditions, these changes can lead to complications like preeclampsia, stillbirth, early delivery, poor foetal growth, or heart problems during or after pregnancy, if not properly monitored.<br />
Pregnancy Complications That Signal Future Heart Risk<br />
Certain pregnancy complications serve as early indicators of heightened cardiovascular risk later in life. Dr. Kua identifies key conditions to watch for:<br />
Preeclampsia<br />
This is when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and often protein in her urine. It’s linked to a 2 to 4 times higher risk of getting high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or heart failure in the future.<br />
Gestational Hypertension<br />
Gestational hypertension means high blood pressure that starts during pregnancy, but without protein in the urine. It may go away after delivery, but it can be an early sign that the woman might develop long-term high blood pressure or heart disease later on.<br />
Gestational Diabetes<br />
Gestational diabetes shows up during pregnancy but usually goes away afterwards. However, it raises the risk of getting type 2 diabetes, metabolic issues, and coronary artery disease down the road.<br />
Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR)<br />
This is when the baby grows too slowly in the womb. It may point to issues with the mother’s blood flow or placenta, and could be a sign of deeper heart or blood vessel problems.<br />
Pre-Term Birth<br />
Giving birth too early can be linked to inflammation and blood vessel problems, which increase the mum’s long-term risk of heart disease.<br />
Stillbirth <br />
Women who experience stillbirth have a higher long-term risk of heart disease, including stroke and myocardial infarction.<br />
“These complications may act as a 'stress test' that reveals hidden problems with blood vessels or metabolism,” Dr. Kua emphasises.<br />
Recognising Early Signs of Cardiovascular Issues During Pregnancy<br />
Many early heart disease symptoms mirror typical pregnancy complaints and are often dismissed. Dr. Kua advises paying close attention to:</p>
<p>Chest pain</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Light-headedness</p>
<p>Tachycardia rapid heart rate (&gt;100 bpm)</p>
<p>Shortness of breath, especially at rest</p>
<p>	Persistent cough</p>
<p>Swelling in the limbs</p>
<p>Frequent nighttime urination</p>
<p>“Symptoms can appear during pregnancy or up to a year postpartum. If persistent, they may indicate a life-threatening cardiovascular condition,” he cautions.<br />
How Can Pregnant Women Manage Heart Disease?<br />
Managing heart conditions during pregnancy requires a combination of proactive planning, vigilant monitoring, and a team-based medical approach. According to Dr. Kua Jieli, “Managing heart problems during pregnancy involves careful planning, close monitoring, and a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to ensure the safety of both mother and baby.”<br />
For women with pre-existing cardiac conditions, preconception counselling is crucial. Risk assessments using tools such as the WHO maternal cardiovascular classification can guide treatment plans. Dr. Kua emphasises that medications like ACE inhibitors, statins, and warfarin should be substituted with pregnancy-safe alternatives before conception.<br />
Throughout pregnancy, routine tests such as echocardiograms and ECGs help monitor heart function. Physicians closely observe symptoms like palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling, which may signal deterioration. Safe medications may include beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics for fluid control, and aspirin for preeclampsia risk reduction.<br />
Dr. Kua notes, “Delivery planning must be individualized, although vaginal delivery is typically preferred unless contraindicated by cardiovascular status.” High-risk deliveries should occur in tertiary centres with cardiac support. Postpartum, the first six weeks are particularly critical, especially for patients with conditions like peripartum cardiomyopathy, necessitating continued monitoring.<br />
Why is Postpartum Cardiovascular Screening Essential?<br />
Despite the clear link between pregnancy complications and future cardiovascular disease (CVD), many postpartum programs omit heart health screening. Dr. Kua stresses that women with prior complications or existing heart disease must undergo routine assessments postpartum.<br />
“A multidisciplinary care approach—starting from delivery and extending up to a year postpartum—can identify risks early and improve long-term outcomes,” he adds.<br />
Common Myths About Pregnancy and Heart Health—Debunked<br />
Misinformation can put maternal health at risk. Dr. Kua addresses prevalent myths:</p>
<p>"Pregnancy is a time to enjoy eating for two people." While it's true that pregnant women need more nutrition, it should never be to the point that they're meeting the caloric needs for two people. Excessive weight gain can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. A balanced diet is key. Plan to gain only 2.3kg in the first half of pregnancy and 0.5kg per week thereafter. </p>
<p>"Eating spicy foods while pregnant can cause birth defects or harm the baby." There is no evidence to suggest spicy foods can harm a developing foetus. But it may worsen heartburn, which can already be a problem during pregnancy.</p>
<p>"It is harmful to the baby when women sleep on their back." There’s no need to panic if a pregnant woman ends up sleeping on her back — but there’s a bit of truth behind the concern. As the baby bump gets bigger, it can press down on a big vein called the inferior vena cava, which brings blood back to the heart. When this vein gets squashed, less blood flows back to the heart and around the body, including to the womb. This might make some women feel dizzy, sweaty, or even a bit nauseous.</p>
<p>"Keeping a pregnant woman’s heart rate lower than 140 bpm." This outdated advice is no longer supported. Regular exercise won’t increase the risk of miscarriage, early delivery, or having a low birth weight baby. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services actually recommends that pregnant women aim for about 150 minutes of moderate to intense exercise each week — and there’s no need to worry about sticking to a strict heart rate limit. However, it’s still important not to push yourself too hard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br />
What Are Preventive Measures to Avoid Heart Issues in Pregnant Women?<br />
Preventive care is fundamental to reducing cardiovascular complications during pregnancy. A heart-healthy lifestyle—balanced nutrition, regular light-to-moderate exercise, and avoiding harmful substances like tobacco and alcohol—lays the groundwork for maternal well-being.<br />
In addition to lifestyle, managing existing risk factors is essential. Conditions such as hypertension and diabetes must be controlled before and during pregnancy to prevent complications. Routine prenatal care allows early detection of warning signs, such as elevated blood pressure, which may indicate conditions like preeclampsia.<br />
Education plays a pivotal role in prevention. Dr. Kua advises that women should seek immediate medical attention for “chest pain, severe breathlessness (especially at rest), rapid weight gain, palpitations, or episodes of fainting,” as these may indicate serious cardiovascular problems.<br />
By empowering women with knowledge and ensuring timely medical intervention, many pregnancy-related heart complications can be mitigated or avoided altogether.<br />
How Cardiologists and OB-GYNs Can Work Together<br />
"Cardiologists and OB-GYNs can enhance maternal care by fostering a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach that begins before conception and extends well into the postpartum period."<br />
Starting with preconception counselling, It should include cardiovascular risk assessment, especially for those who are older, have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a history of heart problems<br />
During pregnancy, doctors from different specialities can come together to create a joint care plan for women with heart issues, whether pre-existing or newly diagnosed. Regular updates between the teams help make sure treatments are adjusted when needed. For high-risk pregnancies, a team that includes maternal-foetal medicine specialists, cardiologists, and anaesthesiologists can work together to ensure safer delivery.<br />
After giving birth, it’s still important to monitor heart health, as some conditions, like pregnancy-related heart conditions like peripartum cardiomyopathy or hypertension, can continue or even show up for the first time postpartum. Using shared health records, integrated care pathways, and joint clinics can help ensure mums get smooth, coordinated care at every stage.<br />
Improving Healthcare Systems for Better Postpartum Heart Health<br />
"Healthcare systems can enhance cardiovascular follow-up for postpartum women by emphasising the importance of a multidisciplinary, team-based approach to postpartum cardiovascular care." Dr. Kua said.<br />
This means cardiologists, OB-GYNs, maternal-foetal medicine specialists, and family doctors should all work closely together to make sure mums get smooth, continuous care from delivery to long-term heart management.<br />
To prevent women with pregnancy-related heart risks from falling through the cracks, hospitals and clinics should set up structured referral systems and personalised follow-up plans. This includes identifying women who are more likely to face heart disease later and helping them manage things like high blood pressure, weight, cholesterol, and stress — especially in the first year after giving birth.<br />
Healthcare professionals can also help by:</p>
<p>Doing standard heart health checks before discharge and during follow-up visits.</p>
<p>Using telehealth (video or phone consults) to make it easier for mums to attend appointments.</p>
<p>Using digital tools, like health apps or reminders, to stay connected with new mums and keep them engaged in their care.</p>
<p>All these steps can help make sure that mothers get the heart care they need — not just during pregnancy, but well after the baby is born.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[What started as a simple act of support soon turned into something much bigger.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="159" data-end="418">You’re probably familiar with <a href="https://hairforhope.org.sg/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hair for Hope</a> — the iconic annual campaign that sees brave souls across Singapore shaving their heads in solidarity with children battling cancer.</p>
<p data-start="159" data-end="418">But have you ever wondered what keeps some people coming back year after year?</p>
<p data-start="420" data-end="753">Meet Jason Ong. He’s a father of two, a consulting manager in the telecom industry, and one of Hair for Hope’s longest-running ambassadors. For 13 years, Jason has shaved, shared, rallied, and repeated — turning a single act of compassion into a lifelong mission to support families facing one of the toughest battles imaginable.</p>
<p data-start="755" data-end="1046">As Singapore celebrates its 60th birthday, the Children’s Cancer Foundation is spotlighting powerful human-interest stories to kick off Hair for Hope 2025.</p>
<p data-start="755" data-end="1046">And Jason’s journey is one worth hearing — not just for the legacy he’s built, but for the community he’s inspired along the way.</p>
<p data-start="755" data-end="1046"> </p>
The First Shave and the Unexpected Chain Reaction
<p data-start="1110" data-end="1307">Jason first picked up the clippers back in 2008. What started as a simple act of support soon turned into something much bigger. Not only did he keep coming back to shave, but he also began organizing satellite events to grow the movement.</p>

<p data-start="1110" data-end="1307"><em><strong>“When I first shaved, my kids were still very young. I don’t think they really understood what was going on,”</strong></em> he recalls.</p>

<p data-start="1309" data-end="1546">But over time, the ritual became a teaching moment — a way to pass on values like empathy, resilience, and purpose. You know how it’s usually the organizers who chase people down? In Jason’s case, it was the opposite. His fellow “shavees” (yes, that’s a word) would beat him to the punch—emailing him months in advance to ask when the next satellite event was happening.</p>
<p data-start="1309" data-end="1546">That’s when he knew: this wasn’t just a one-off effort. It had become a community.</p>

<p data-start="1309" data-end="1546"><em><strong>“Each year when I shaved, I explained to them why I was doing it — to support children with cancer and their families.”</strong></em></p>
</p>

38 June School Holiday Activities & Events for Kids

<p data-start="1548" data-end="1777">In 2010, when Jason organised his first Hair for Hope satellite event, he tried to get his son and daughter — then 10 and 8 years old — to join him on stage.</p>

<p data-start="1548" data-end="1777"><em><strong>“I kept pressing them to shave, but they kept refusing,”</strong></em> he laughs.</p>

<p data-start="1779" data-end="1818">Until one day, his son surprised him.</p>

<p data-start="1820" data-end="2033"><em><strong>“Just before the event, he told me he wanted to shave. I asked him why he changed his mind, and he said a classmate had cancer — he wanted to support him. I was really touched. It meant the message had sunk in.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2035" data-end="2426">That same day, Jason’s daughter joined her brother in solidarity.</p>

<p data-start="2035" data-end="2426"><em><strong>“Both of them shaved at the first satellite event. My son continued into his secondary school years, and my daughter shaved again when she was 12 and 16. They’ve stopped shaving for now — they’re quite attached to their hair — but they still help out at events, ushering and setting up. They’re still part of the movement.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2035" data-end="2426">Even as the kids grew older and stopped shaving their heads, they never stopped showing up. These days, they’re right there beside him at the events, helping with logistics—ushering guests, setting up stations, and quietly making things run smoothly behind the scenes.</p>
<p data-start="2035" data-end="2426"> </p>
What Keeps Jason Coming Back?
<p data-start="2948" data-end="3185">Motivation is a funny thing. You’d think after 13 years, the enthusiasm might fade. But for Jason, it’s only grown. When people around you believe in a cause so deeply that they nudge <em data-start="3132" data-end="3137">you</em> about the next event, that’s something special.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969127" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Hair for Hope</p>

<p data-start="3187" data-end="3412">He’s seen the campaign evolve, watched his shavees return year after year, and built bonds with strangers who eventually became friends. That kind of community doesn’t just happen—it takes someone like Jason to make it stick.</p>
<p data-start="3414" data-end="3771">And if you&#8217;re wondering what it&#8217;s like to shave your head for the first time, Jason gets the hesitation. Will the hair grow back the same? Will I look weird bald? Valid concerns. But as he likes to say, it’s worth doing at least once—if not for the look, then for the lesson.</p>
<p data-start="3414" data-end="3771">More importantly, you’re showing children battling cancer that they’re not alone.</p>

            <media:text type="plain"><![CDATA[<p>You’re probably familiar with Hair for Hope — the iconic annual campaign that sees brave souls across Singapore shaving their heads in solidarity with children battling cancer.<br />
But have you ever wondered what keeps some people coming back year after year?<br />
Meet Jason Ong. He’s a father of two, a consulting manager in the telecom industry, and one of Hair for Hope’s longest-running ambassadors. For 13 years, Jason has shaved, shared, rallied, and repeated — turning a single act of compassion into a lifelong mission to support families facing one of the toughest battles imaginable.<br />
As Singapore celebrates its 60th birthday, the Children’s Cancer Foundation is spotlighting powerful human-interest stories to kick off Hair for Hope 2025.<br />
And Jason’s journey is one worth hearing — not just for the legacy he’s built, but for the community he’s inspired along the way.<br />
 <br />
The First Shave and the Unexpected Chain Reaction<br />
Jason first picked up the clippers back in 2008. What started as a simple act of support soon turned into something much bigger. Not only did he keep coming back to shave, but he also began organizing satellite events to grow the movement.</p>
<p>“When I first shaved, my kids were still very young. I don’t think they really understood what was going on,” he recalls.</p>
<p>But over time, the ritual became a teaching moment — a way to pass on values like empathy, resilience, and purpose. You know how it’s usually the organizers who chase people down? In Jason’s case, it was the opposite. His fellow “shavees” (yes, that’s a word) would beat him to the punch—emailing him months in advance to ask when the next satellite event was happening.<br />
That’s when he knew: this wasn’t just a one-off effort. It had become a community.</p>
<p>“Each year when I shaved, I explained to them why I was doing it — to support children with cancer and their families.”</p>
<p>In 2010, when Jason organised his first Hair for Hope satellite event, he tried to get his son and daughter — then 10 and 8 years old — to join him on stage.</p>
<p>“I kept pressing them to shave, but they kept refusing,” he laughs.</p>
<p>Until one day, his son surprised him.</p>
<p>“Just before the event, he told me he wanted to shave. I asked him why he changed his mind, and he said a classmate had cancer — he wanted to support him. I was really touched. It meant the message had sunk in.”</p>
<p>That same day, Jason’s daughter joined her brother in solidarity.</p>
<p>“Both of them shaved at the first satellite event. My son continued into his secondary school years, and my daughter shaved again when she was 12 and 16. They’ve stopped shaving for now — they’re quite attached to their hair — but they still help out at events, ushering and setting up. They’re still part of the movement.”</p>
<p>Even as the kids grew older and stopped shaving their heads, they never stopped showing up. These days, they’re right there beside him at the events, helping with logistics—ushering guests, setting up stations, and quietly making things run smoothly behind the scenes.<br />
 <br />
What Keeps Jason Coming Back?<br />
Motivation is a funny thing. You’d think after 13 years, the enthusiasm might fade. But for Jason, it’s only grown. When people around you believe in a cause so deeply that they nudge you about the next event, that’s something special.</p>
<p>He’s seen the campaign evolve, watched his shavees return year after year, and built bonds with strangers who eventually became friends. That kind of community doesn’t just happen—it takes someone like Jason to make it stick.<br />
And if you're wondering what it's like to shave your head for the first time, Jason gets the hesitation. Will the hair grow back the same? Will I look weird bald? Valid concerns. But as he likes to say, it’s worth doing at least once—if not for the look, then for the lesson.<br />
More importantly, you’re showing children battling cancer that they’re not alone.</p>
<p> <br />
Busting the Bald Myths<br />
Let’s address the elephant in the room. Yes, shaving your head is a bold move. And no, it’s not a “get out of shampoo free” card.</p>
<p>“I know many people want to support, but they’re afraid,” he says. “Some worry their hair won’t grow back. Others worry they won’t look good bald.”</p>
<p>His advice? Give it a try — just once.</p>
<p>Jason laughs about how people often assume shaving means less effort. But in reality, scalp care is still a thing—especially in sunny Singapore. Even with a smooth head, you’ll need proper washing, sunscreen, and yes, shampoo.<br />
The key message? Don’t let vanity or myths hold you back from doing something good.<br />
 <br />
Together, We Can... And Should<br />
This year’s theme for Hair for Hope is “Together, We Can” — and it perfectly sums up Jason’s journey.<br />
Through his efforts, Jason has not only supported children with cancer — he’s rallied a community, instilled lifelong values in his kids, and shown what it means to be an everyday hero.</p>

<p>If Jason’s story moved you, maybe it’s time to take that leap yourself. Hair for Hope 2025 is more than just a campaign—it’s a national movement of solidarity, compassion, and courage.<br />
Don’t worry about the bald head. Worry about the kind of impact you want to leave behind.<br />

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine preparing for the arrival of your baby, only to discover that your little one is expected to be significantly larger than average. This scenario is a reality for many expectant parents facing fetal macrosomia. It is a condition where a newborn weighs more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams), regardless of gestational age.</p>
<p>While a chubby baby might seem adorable, fetal macrosomia can lead to complications for both mother and child during delivery and beyond.</p>
<p>Understanding the causes, risks, and management strategies is crucial for ensuring the health and safety of both.</p>

<strong data-start="335" data-end="364">What Is Fetal Macrosomia?</strong>
<p data-start="366" data-end="524">Fetal macrosomia refers to a condition where a baby is born with a weight exceeding 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams). In some definitions, a weight over 9 pounds, 15 ounces (4,500 grams) is considered macrosomic.</p>
<p data-start="366" data-end="524">This condition is distinct from &#8220;large for gestational age&#8221; (LGA), which considers the baby&#8217;s weight relative to the gestational age.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Explore the causes, symptoms, and treatments of obstetric fistula, a preventable childbirth injury affecting women worldwide. Learn about prevention strategies and available support systems.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="205" data-end="963"><a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/4-fetal-positions-in-the-womb" >Childbirth </a>should be a moment of joy, yet for thousands of women especially in low-resource settings, it becomes a source of lifelong suffering due to a preventable injury known as obstetric fistula. This condition not only leads to chronic physical discomfort and incontinence, but also strips women of their dignity, often resulting in social isolation, depression, and economic hardship.</p>
<p data-start="205" data-end="963">Despite being nearly eliminated in high-income countries, obstetric fistula remains a widespread issue in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, underscoring a profound global health disparity.</p>
<p data-start="205" data-end="963">This article explores the underlying causes, signs, treatment options, and global efforts aimed at eradicating this devastating condition once and for all.</p>

<strong data-start="518" data-end="548">What is Obstetric Fistula?</strong>
<p data-start="550" data-end="708">Obstetric fistula is an abnormal connection between a woman&#8217;s genital tract and her urinary tract or rectum, typically resulting from prolonged obstructed labor. The pressure from the baby&#8217;s head during extended labor can cut off blood flow to the surrounding tissues, causing them to die and creating a hole. This condition is most prevalent in regions with limited access to quality maternal healthcare.</p>
<strong data-start="714" data-end="744">Types of Obstetric Fistula</strong>


<p data-start="748" data-end="820"><strong data-start="748" data-end="780">Vesicovaginal Fistula (VVF):</strong> An opening between the bladder and the vagina, leading to continuous urinary incontinence.</p>


<p data-start="823" data-end="894"><strong data-start="823" data-end="854">Rectovaginal Fistula (RVF):</strong> An opening between the rectum and the vagina, resulting in fecal incontinence.</p>


<p data-start="897" data-end="997"><strong data-start="897" data-end="918">Combined Fistula:</strong> Involves both urinary and fecal incontinence due to multiple openings.</p>



<strong data-start="1007" data-end="1034">Causes and Risk Factors</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969092" class="wp-caption-text">What You Need To Know About Obstetric Fistula</p>

<strong data-start="1040" data-end="1070">Prolonged Obstructed Labor</strong>
<p data-start="1072" data-end="1190">The primary cause of obstetric fistula is prolonged obstructed labor, where the baby cannot pass through the birth canal due to its size or the mother&#8217;s pelvic structure.

            <media:text type="plain"><![CDATA[<p>Childbirth should be a moment of joy, yet for thousands of women especially in low-resource settings, it becomes a source of lifelong suffering due to a preventable injury known as obstetric fistula. This condition not only leads to chronic physical discomfort and incontinence, but also strips women of their dignity, often resulting in social isolation, depression, and economic hardship.<br />
Despite being nearly eliminated in high-income countries, obstetric fistula remains a widespread issue in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, underscoring a profound global health disparity.<br />
This article explores the underlying causes, signs, treatment options, and global efforts aimed at eradicating this devastating condition once and for all.</p>
<p>What is Obstetric Fistula?<br />
Obstetric fistula is an abnormal connection between a woman's genital tract and her urinary tract or rectum, typically resulting from prolonged obstructed labor. The pressure from the baby's head during extended labor can cut off blood flow to the surrounding tissues, causing them to die and creating a hole. This condition is most prevalent in regions with limited access to quality maternal healthcare.<br />
Types of Obstetric Fistula</p>
<p>Vesicovaginal Fistula (VVF): An opening between the bladder and the vagina, leading to continuous urinary incontinence.</p>
<p>Rectovaginal Fistula (RVF): An opening between the rectum and the vagina, resulting in fecal incontinence.</p>
<p>Combined Fistula: Involves both urinary and fecal incontinence due to multiple openings.</p>
<p>Causes and Risk Factors</p>
<p>Prolonged Obstructed Labor<br />
The primary cause of obstetric fistula is prolonged obstructed labor, where the baby cannot pass through the birth canal due to its size or the mother's pelvic structure. Without timely medical intervention, such as a cesarean section, the sustained pressure can lead to tissue necrosis and fistula formation.<br />
Lack of Access to Quality Maternal Healthcare<br />
In many low-resource settings, women lack access to skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care. This deficiency increases the risk of complications during childbirth, including fistula development.<br />
Early Marriage and Teenage Pregnancy<br />
Young girls who marry and become pregnant before their bodies are fully developed are at higher risk of obstructed labor, leading to a greater likelihood of fistula.<br />
Malnutrition<br />
Poor nutrition can result in stunted growth and underdeveloped pelvises in women, making childbirth more difficult and increasing the risk of obstructed labor and fistula.<br />
 <br />
Symptoms and Diagnosis<br />
Common Symptoms</p>
<p>Continuous Leakage: Involuntary leakage of urine or feces through the vagina.</p>
<p>Foul-Smelling Discharge: Persistent, unpleasant-smelling vaginal discharge.</p>
<p>Recurrent Infections: Frequent urinary tract or vaginal infections.</p>
<p>Skin Irritation: Irritation and sores in the genital area due to constant wetness.</p>
<p>Social Isolation: Withdrawal from social interactions due to embarrassment and stigma.</p>
<p>Diagnostic Procedures</p>
<p>Physical Examination: A thorough pelvic exam to identify any abnormal openings.</p>
<p>Dye Tests: Introducing a dye into the bladder to observe any leakage into the vagina, confirming a fistula.</p>
<p>Imaging Tests: Utilizing imaging techniques like fistulograms to determine the fistula's size and location.</p>
<p>Treatment Option</p>
<p>Surgical Interventions<br />
Surgical repair is the primary treatment for obstetric fistula. The procedure involves closing the abnormal opening and restoring normal function. Success rates vary, with studies indicating closure rates ranging from 77.85% to 88.1%, depending on various factors, including the fistula's complexity and the patient's overall health. Post-operative care is crucial to ensure healing and prevent recurrence.<br />
Non-Surgical Support</p>
<p>Counseling: Providing psychological support to help women cope with the trauma and stigma associated with fistula.</p>
<p>Reintegration Programs: Assisting women in returning to their communities through education and vocational training.</p>
<p>Physical Therapy: Rehabilitation exercises to strengthen pelvic muscles and improve continence.</p>
<p>Prevention Strategies<br />
Improving Maternal Healthcare<br />
Ensuring access to quality maternal healthcare is vital. This includes:</p>
<p>Skilled Birth Attendants: Training and deploying healthcare professionals to assist during childbirth.</p>
<p>Emergency Obstetric Care: Establishing facilities equipped to handle childbirth complications.</p>
<p>Antenatal Care: Regular check-ups during pregnancy to monitor the mother's and baby's health.</p>
<p>Community Education<br />
Educating communities about the importance of maternal health can lead to:</p>
<p>Delayed Marriages: Encouraging girls to marry and conceive at a mature age.</p>
<p>Nutrition Awareness: Promoting proper nutrition for girls and women.</p>
<p>Health-Seeking Behavior: Encouraging women to seek medical care during pregnancy and childbirth.</p>
<p> <br />
Obstetric fistula remains a significant public health issue, particularly in low-resource settings. However, with concerted efforts focusing on prevention, timely treatment, and community support, it is a condition that can be eradicated.<br />
Empowering women through education, improving access to quality maternal healthcare, and supporting affected individuals are crucial steps toward a fistula-free world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="495" data-end="912">Over the past several months, Punggol residents have faced an unexpected challenge—monkey intrusions. With <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/200-reports-of-monkeys-in-punggol-over-7-month-period-some-euthanised-nparks?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=stfb" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >over 200 incidents reported within just seven months</a>, the community is on high alert, especially parents concerned for their children&#8217;s safety. These encounters, often involving long-tailed macaques, are more than mere inconveniences—they&#8217;re disrupting routines, scaring kids, and exposing gaps in home safety.</p>
<strong data-start="1595" data-end="1642">Why Are Monkeys Entering Residential Areas?</strong>
<p data-start="1645" data-end="1803">Rapid urban development has pushed monkeys out of their habitats, while human activities like feeding or leaving food exposed encourage them to explore homes.</p>
<p data-start="1805" data-end="2120">With forested zones replaced by high-rise developments, monkeys have lost access to their usual food sources. The lure of open windows, food scraps, and even toys mimicking snacks drives them to explore human dwellings. Feeding monkeys, whether intentional or not, reinforces this behavior and escalates encounters.</p>
<strong data-start="2131" data-end="2169">What Kind of Monkeys Are Involved?</strong>
<p data-start="2172" data-end="2313">The long-tailed macaques are the species most commonly seen around Punggol and are known for their intelligence, curiosity, and adaptability.</p>
<p data-start="2315" data-end="2622">Long-tailed macaques are highly adaptive and intelligent primates. Their curiosity, combined with memory and social learning, makes them quick to identify accessible homes and revisit those with food rewards. These monkeys are not inherently aggressive but can become bold when accustomed to human presence.</p>
<strong data-start="2632" data-end="2665">How to Monkey-Proof Your Home</strong>
<strong data-start="2676" data-end="2716">Simple, Effective Home Modifications</strong>
<p data-start="2719" data-end="2868">Install grilles, locks, and netting on windows and balconies to block entry. Motion-sensor devices and visual deterrents can also help reduce visits.</p>
<p data-start="2870" data-end="3118">Install window grilles, child-safe latches, and mesh screens, especially on windows or balconies adjacent to green spaces. Motion-sensor alarms or deterrents like reflective tape or ultrasonic devices can reduce repeat visits from familiar monkeys.</p>

            <media:text type="plain"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past several months, Punggol residents have faced an unexpected challenge—monkey intrusions. With over 200 incidents reported within just seven months, the community is on high alert, especially parents concerned for their children's safety. These encounters, often involving long-tailed macaques, are more than mere inconveniences—they're disrupting routines, scaring kids, and exposing gaps in home safety.<br />
Why Are Monkeys Entering Residential Areas?<br />
Rapid urban development has pushed monkeys out of their habitats, while human activities like feeding or leaving food exposed encourage them to explore homes.<br />
With forested zones replaced by high-rise developments, monkeys have lost access to their usual food sources. The lure of open windows, food scraps, and even toys mimicking snacks drives them to explore human dwellings. Feeding monkeys, whether intentional or not, reinforces this behavior and escalates encounters.<br />
What Kind of Monkeys Are Involved?<br />
The long-tailed macaques are the species most commonly seen around Punggol and are known for their intelligence, curiosity, and adaptability.<br />
Long-tailed macaques are highly adaptive and intelligent primates. Their curiosity, combined with memory and social learning, makes them quick to identify accessible homes and revisit those with food rewards. These monkeys are not inherently aggressive but can become bold when accustomed to human presence.<br />
How to Monkey-Proof Your Home<br />
Simple, Effective Home Modifications<br />
Install grilles, locks, and netting on windows and balconies to block entry. Motion-sensor devices and visual deterrents can also help reduce visits.<br />
Install window grilles, child-safe latches, and mesh screens, especially on windows or balconies adjacent to green spaces. Motion-sensor alarms or deterrents like reflective tape or ultrasonic devices can reduce repeat visits from familiar monkeys.<br />
Daily Habits That Prevent Intrusions<br />
Secure food and baby items out of sight, and avoid actions that can unintentionally attract or reward monkey behavior.<br />
Keep all food out of sight—fruit bowls, leftovers, snacks, and even empty wrappers. Refrain from feeding monkeys, even accidentally. Avoid leaving baby bottles or lunch boxes near doors or windows. Store outdoor items like strollers or diaper bags indoors.<br />
Helping Children Cope with Monkey Encounters<br />
Emotional Impact on Kids<br />
Children may feel afraid after a monkey intrusion and need reassurance, validation, and open conversations to feel safe again.<br />
Children might develop fears of being alone or near balconies and windows. They may express these fears as nightmares, anxiety, or resistance to playing in familiar spaces. Open communication is essential—listen and acknowledge their fears without dismissing them.<br />
Teaching Safety Without Instilling Fear<br />
Turn the experience into a teachable moment by promoting respectful behavior and safety without causing unnecessary fear.<br />
Turn the incident into a learning opportunity. Teach kids about the importance of boundaries and respecting animals. Reinforce safe practices like not leaving food out and alerting adults if they see monkeys nearby.<br />
Extra Protection for Babies and Toddlers<br />
Safe Space Layout Tips<br />
Reorganize baby and toddler areas to avoid exposure near open windows, and ensure furnishings help keep little ones secure.<br />
If your child’s play or sleep area is near open windows, consider rearranging furniture to place cribs or playpens further away. Add high latches to reduce unsupervised access.<br />

            <media:text type="plain"><![CDATA[<p>Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are one of the most common health concerns for babies and young children. From the sniffles to serious hospital stays, RTIs can take a toll, not just on children, but on their families too.<br />
While medical care is always important, prevention is still the best first line of defense, especially for little ones. And one of the most powerful, natural ways to protect your baby? Breastfeeding.<br />
Why Are RTIs a Big Deal?</p>
<p>RTIs affect the nose, throat, airways, and lungs. They can range from mild colds to more serious conditions like bronchiolitis or pneumonia. For babies under 2 years old, these infections can lead to:</p>

]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Symptoms of being infected with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus are said to be similar to the common flu. However, experts have recently called itchy eyes a symptom of Omicron.</p>
<p>Conjunctivitis or inflammation in the form of itchy and red eyes is said to be one of the symptoms of Omicron. According to experts, the virus that attacks the respiratory tract can also affect the sense of sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some viruses that attack the respiratory tract can affect the eye area,&#8221; said infectious disease expert from the Johns Hopkins Center, Amesh A. Adalja, MD, quoted from<em>CNBC</em>, Thursday, January 27, 2022.</p>
<p><em>American Academy of Ophthalmology</em>said that conjunctivitis can show symptoms such as red, watery, itchy eyes and blurred vision. These complaints also occurred in previous COVID-19 viruses, so experts said it could possibly appear in COVID-19 symptoms Omicron.</p>
<p>Dr Nina Aslam also expressed the same opinion. As quoted from<em>Express</em>, conjunctivitis or pink eye is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is the thin membrane that lines the inside of your eyelids.</p>
<p>Dr Aslam said that Omicron&#8217;s symptoms can surprisingly cause conjunctivitis. A woman was found to have mild respiratory symptoms but showed severe conjunctivitis, and she tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Dr Aslam also explained how the COVID-19 virus can attack the eyes. &#8220;The cell receptors that the Covid variant uses to enter the body are in the eyes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Aslam added that previous studies have also suggested that Omicron may have a greater capacity to affect the eyes than other variants.</p>
<p>Red eyes due to Omicron can appear even though the infected person does not experience symptoms of respiratory problems.</p>
If Red Eyes are Due to Omicron

<p>If you experience symptoms of red eyes, doctors recommend that you try to maintain eye hygiene. Clean eye discharge properly.</p>
<p>“Wipe the eye crust using clean cotton dipped in cooled boiled water,” said Aslam.</p>
<p>In cases of mild conjunctivitis infection, we can use certain eye drops or eye ointments as treatment.</p>
<strong>Main Symptoms of COVID-19 Omicron</strong>
<p>Common signs of Omicron according to ZOE Covid research include:</p>

Dry/itchy throat
Have a cold
Sneeze
Mild muscle pain
Fatigue

<p>In addition, there are other, less common signs, including brain fog, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, nausea or vomiting, with some people also experiencing difficulty sleeping and night sweats.</p>
<p>Recently, a Berlin hospital revealed that fainting could be a symptom of COVID-19 infection Omicron.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CDC said, there are symptoms that should immediately get medical help. Namely if it happens: skin and lips and nails become pale, where this symptom indicates very low oxygen levels in the blood.</p>
Omicron Case in Indonesia

<p>Quoting Kata Data, the development of COVID-19 cases of the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) in Indonesia has reached 1,665 cases as of Tuesday, January 25, 2022.</p>
<p>The figure has a difference of 259 cases compared to the previous day. On a weekly basis, COVID-19 cases in Indonesia grew by 137.86 percent.</p>
<p>With the number of Omicron variants, Indonesia is in first place in Southeast Asia. The country with the highest Omicron cases in Southeast Asia is still Singapore with 1,169 cases.</p>
<p>Next is Thailand, which recorded 75.92 percent higher Omicron cases compared to last week. As for daily data, the number of Omicron cases in this country increased by 18.05 percent compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>Then, Malaysia with the number of Omicron cases 463 cases (this number has not changed from the previous). The number of Omicron cases in Cambodia rose 38.26 percent to 159 cases, compared to the previous week and the number of Omicron cases in Vietnam rose 637.5 percent to 59 cases compared to the previous week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the total number of Omicron COVID-19 cases worldwide reached 580.73 thousand cases. The number of COVID-19 variants increased compared to the previous week which amounted to 391.34 thousand cases.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the explanation of itchy eyes which are said to be one of the early signs of Omicron infection. The pandemic is not over yet, so keep implementing health protocols and take care of your health and that of your family, okay!</p>

Conjunctivitis or inflammation in the form of itchy and red eyes is said to be one of the symptoms of Omicron. According to experts, the virus that attacks the respiratory tract can also affect the sense of sight.<br />
"Some viruses that attack the respiratory tract can affect the eye area," said infectious disease expert from the Johns Hopkins Center, Amesh A. Adalja, MD, quoted fromCNBC, Thursday, January 27, 2022.<br />
American Academy of Ophthalmologysaid that conjunctivitis can show symptoms such as red, watery, itchy eyes and blurred vision. These complaints also occurred in previous COVID-19 viruses, so experts said it could possibly appear in COVID-19 symptoms Omicron.<br />
Dr Nina Aslam also expressed the same opinion. As quoted fromExpress, conjunctivitis or pink eye is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is the thin membrane that lines the inside of your eyelids.<br />
Dr Aslam said that Omicron's symptoms can surprisingly cause conjunctivitis. A woman was found to have mild respiratory symptoms but showed severe conjunctivitis, and she tested positive for the coronavirus.<br />
Dr Aslam also explained how the COVID-19 virus can attack the eyes. "The cell receptors that the Covid variant uses to enter the body are in the eyes," he said.<br />
Dr. Aslam added that previous studies have also suggested that Omicron may have a greater capacity to affect the eyes than other variants.<br />
Red eyes due to Omicron can appear even though the infected person does not experience symptoms of respiratory problems.<br />
If Red Eyes are Due to Omicron</p>
<p>If you experience symptoms of red eyes, doctors recommend that you try to maintain eye hygiene. Clean eye discharge properly.<br />
“Wipe the eye crust using clean cotton dipped in cooled boiled water,” said Aslam.<br />
In cases of mild conjunctivitis infection, we can use certain eye drops or eye ointments as treatment.<br />
Main Symptoms of COVID-19 Omicron<br />
Common signs of Omicron according to ZOE Covid research include:</p>
<p>	Dry/itchy throat<br />
	Have a cold<br />
	Sneeze<br />
	Mild muscle pain<br />
	Fatigue</p>
<p>In addition, there are other, less common signs, including brain fog, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, nausea or vomiting, with some people also experiencing difficulty sleeping and night sweats.<br />
Recently, a Berlin hospital revealed that fainting could be a symptom of COVID-19 infection Omicron.<br />
Meanwhile, the CDC said, there are symptoms that should immediately get medical help. Namely if it happens: skin and lips and nails become pale, where this symptom indicates very low oxygen levels in the blood.<br />
Omicron Case in Indonesia</p>
<p>Quoting Kata Data, the development of COVID-19 cases of the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) in Indonesia has reached 1,665 cases as of Tuesday, January 25, 2022.<br />
The figure has a difference of 259 cases compared to the previous day. On a weekly basis, COVID-19 cases in Indonesia grew by 137.86 percent.<br />
With the number of Omicron variants, Indonesia is in first place in Southeast Asia. The country with the highest Omicron cases in Southeast Asia is still Singapore with 1,169 cases.<br />
Next is Thailand, which recorded 75.92 percent higher Omicron cases compared to last week. As for daily data, the number of Omicron cases in this country increased by 18.05 percent compared to yesterday.<br />
Then, Malaysia with the number of Omicron cases 463 cases (this number has not changed from the previous). The number of Omicron cases in Cambodia rose 38.26 percent to 159 cases, compared to the previous week and the number of Omicron cases in Vietnam rose 637.5 percent to 59 cases compared to the previous week.<br />
Meanwhile, the total number of Omicron COVID-19 cases worldwide reached 580.73 thousand cases. The number of COVID-19 variants increased compared to the previous week which amounted to 391.34 thousand cases.<br />
That's the explanation of itchy eyes which are said to be one of the early signs of Omicron infection. The pandemic is not over yet, so keep implementing health protocols and take care of your health and that of your family, okay!<br />

            <description><![CDATA[Turner syndrome can be detected if there is growth retardation, heart defects, reproductive problems and learning difficulties.
]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>What is Turner Syndrome?</strong>
<p>Turner syndrome is a rare genetic condition that only affects females. It occurs when one of the two X chromosomes that should be present in a female&#8217;s body is missing or does not function properly.</p>
<p>The X chromosome is very important because it stores much of the genetic information needed for normal growth and development. Without a complete X <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://my.theasianparent.com/penyakit-kelainan-kromosom" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >chromosome , females with this disease may face several challenges in their physical and health aspects.</a></p>
<strong>What Are the Symptoms of Turner Syndrome?</strong>
<p>Symptoms vary depending on the individual, but some of the most common signs include:</p>
<strong>1. Stunted Growth</strong>
<p>Children with the syndrome may be shorter than their peers. They will usually experience slower growth and will reach a lower adult height.</p>
<strong>2. Certain Physical Characteristics</strong>
<p>Women with Turner Syndrome may have certain physical characteristics such as a short and wide neck, low-set ears, or a lower hairline at the back of the head.</p>
<strong>3.Heart Defect</strong>
<p>Heart problems such as aortic stenosis (narrowing of the main <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://my.theasianparent.com/alat-cegah-hamil" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >blood vessel</a>  ) or other heart problems can occur.</p>
<strong>4.Reproduction Problems</strong>
<p>Women who experience this problem often experience ovarian failure, which means they may not have periods or have difficulty getting pregnant.</p>
<strong>5. Learning Problems</strong>
<p>Although most children with Turner Syndrome have a normal IQ, some may have difficulty with math and spatial skills.</p>
<strong>What Causes Turner Syndrome?</strong>
<p>The main cause is the loss or abnormality of the X chromosome that should be present in every cell of a female body. Every female has two X chromosomes, but in the case of Turner syndrome one of the X chromosomes is completely missing or partially non-functional.</p>
<p>This happens randomly during the formation of an egg or <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://my.theasianparent.com/pancut-awal-boleh-mengandung" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >sperm</a> cell , and there is no specific reason that can cause this to happen.</p>
<strong>Risk Factors</strong>
<p>Turner syndrome is not something that is inherited from families, but is the result of genetic changes that occur by chance.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are no specific risk factors that can increase a person&#8217;s chances of developing it. However, it is more likely to occur in individuals with older mothers, but again, this occurrence is very rare.</p>
<strong>Diagnosis and Treatment</strong>
<p>Doctors can usually diagnose Turner Syndrome based on the physical characteristics of the child. However, to confirm the diagnosis, several tests are needed.</p>
<p>One of these is a blood test, where a small sample of blood is taken and examined to see if one X chromosome is missing. From there, the doctor will count the number of chromosomes in <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://my.theasianparent.com/darah-beku" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the blood cells</a>  and assess their shape and size.</p>
<p>All of this is known as the “human phenotype.” In addition, other tests may be needed to check for other health problems, such as heart or kidney problems, which are often associated with Turner Syndrome.</p>
<strong>How Are Turner Syndrome Patients Treated?</strong>
<p>Treatment for Turner Syndrome usually involves hormone therapy, which aims to help the body readjust.</p>
<p>Hormones are chemicals in the body that control growth and many other functions. For example, growth hormone can help increase growth rate, giving you the opportunity to add a few inches to your height.</p>
<p>When entering puberty, female hormones will be given to stimulate physical development, such as breast growth and the start of menstruation.</p>
<p>Additionally, if there are heart or kidney problems, certain medications may be needed. Specialists, including geneticists and <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://my.theasianparent.com/sebab-mengapa-susah-untuk-mengandung" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >endocrinologists</a> , will work with the doctor to ensure the best treatment is chosen, to help the patient live a healthier life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some pregnant mothers may experience <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/brown-discharge-during-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy. This</a> is one of the symptoms that early pregnant mothers are quite worried about. Is there something wrong with their bodies? If pregnant women have brown vaginal discharge, will the fetus be okay? Today, TAP has compiled the causes, symptoms, and results of vaginal discharge turning brown in pregnant mothers. Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
Why is vaginal discharge brown?
<p>For most women, having a change in the color of vaginal discharge is a cause for concern because it could be a sign that our body is trying to tell us. Let’s take a look at why vaginal discharge turns brown.</p>
1. The beginning or end of the menstrual cycle.
<p>A woman&#8217;s menstruation is the blood flowing out of the vagina. Generally, there will be a lot or a little depending on the person. Normally, the brown discharge is caused by the reaction of the vagina to menstruation or the body&#8217;s natural vaginal cleansing.</p>
2. Hormone deficiency
<p>Sometimes, brown discharge can be a sign of an imbalance of estrogen hormones, with too little estrogen flowing to the lining of the vagina. In addition to brown discharge, other symptoms may include:</p>

Feeling hot flashes
<a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/first-trimester-to-sleep-130420" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cannot sleep</a>
Mood swings or depression
No concentration
Urinary tract infection
Weight gain


3. Birth control pills
<p>Taking birth control pills or taking hormonal <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%84%e0%b8%b8%e0%b8%a1%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%b3%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%94-%e0%b9%81%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%b0%e0%b8%9c%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%82%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%87%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%84%e0%b8%b5%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%87" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >birth control pills</a> may cause brown vaginal discharge during the first month of taking the pills. This includes irregular bleeding that may occur more often. If you take the birth control pills that contain less than 35 micrograms of estrogen, it can affect your menstrual period. And if you miss a period for too long, your body and the color of the vaginal discharge may change to a brown color.</p>
4. Ovulation
<p>Normally, ovulation occurs in the middle of a woman&#8217;s menstrual cycle, which is when the egg moves out of the ovary to await fertilization with sperm. Therefore, each month, women are likely to have brown vaginal discharge due to the movement of the egg, and other symptoms such as lower abdominal pain and changes in body temperature.</p>
5. Ovarian cysts
<p>Ovarian cysts, or polycystic ovaries, are fluid-filled sacs inside an ovary that can develop and enlarge. They can occur on one or both sides of your uterus, and can cause a variety of symptoms, including brown vaginal discharge and pelvic pain.</p>
6. Medically-associated infections (STIs)
<p>Medically-related infections can cause brown vaginal discharge or vaginal bleeding. Some infections, such as gonorrhea or non-gonococcal urethritis, may not show symptoms in the early stages, but later on, there will be pain in the genitals while urinating, pelvic pain, and vaginal discharge that changes color, etc.</p>


If I have brown vaginal discharge, should I see a doctor?
<p>In many cases, the brown discharge may be old blood that the body has expelled from the uterus to cleanse the uterus, especially at the beginning and end of the menstrual cycle. But don&#8217;t forget to observe other symptoms if you feel any abnormalities in your body or you should see a doctor immediately if you feel that it is not discharge before or after your <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/how-to-check-monthly-period" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >period</a> because it may become a serious disease. You should see a doctor if you have the following symptoms along with brown discharge:</p>

Vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor or itching
Lower abdominal pain or pain during intercourse
Have a fever or other symptoms that are signs of infection.
There is a large amount of vaginal discharge or there is fresh blood mixed in.
Vaginal discharge lasts for more than 3 days.

What causes brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy?
<p>The reason why pregnant women have brown discharge, especially early pregnancy mothers, if they have brown discharge, it is usually due to irritation, increased hormones, and increased blood flow during pregnancy, which makes the cervix very fragile. Or having sex during pregnancy and a pelvic exam that may be harsh can also cause brown discharge. In addition, finding brown discharge during pregnancy near the end of pregnancy is a warning sign that the mother is about to give birth, no more than 2-3 weeks away, or some mothers may have it 2-3 days before the baby is born. In addition, mothers who are about to give birth may have symptoms such as bleeding from the vagina or blood mixed with the discharge. However, if you are not sure about the bleeding, consult a specialist immediately.</p>
Causes of brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy
<p>Pregnancy causes many changes in the body of a mother, including the occurrence of brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy. This is due to the change in pH in the female genital area, which may cause a small amount of vaginal discharge and is not a cause for much concern. The occurrence of brown vaginal discharge may occur for 2-3 days and then disappears naturally.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is considered normal for pregnant women. Sometimes, there may be a little blood mixed in. This may be caused by the mother&#8217;s physical activities, such as <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/running-while-pregnant-benefits-baby-090320" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >exercising,</a> carrying heavy objects, cleaning the house too hard, or having sex. However, if you find that the discharge smells bad or feel a burning or itchy sensation in the vagina, it may be a symptom indicating a serious change, including:</p>

<strong>Infection:</strong> Because pregnant women are at higher risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases than normal women.
<strong>Risk of miscarriage.</strong> Most often, the risk of miscarriage occurs when the fetus is about 10 weeks old. Symptoms will occur suddenly and include a brown or red discharge from the vagina. Other symptoms include <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/cramp-pregnency" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cramps</a> or pain in the lower abdomen, blood clots in the vagina, dizziness, or fainting.
<strong>An ectopic pregnancy</strong> is when a fertilized egg implants in a fallopian tube or into an ovary, abdomen, or cervix. This is called an ectopic pregnancy. In addition to brown discharge, an ectopic pregnancy may cause other symptoms, including sudden pain in the abdomen, pelvis, neck, and shoulders, pelvic pain on one side of the body, dizziness, or fainting.
<strong>Cervical infection </strong> : When the cervix becomes inflamed for whatever reason, such as a bacterial infection, an allergy to feminine hygiene products, or a hormonal imbalance, pregnant women may experience the following symptoms: a large amount of vaginal discharge, which may have an odor, lower abdominal pain, vaginal pain, back pain, or pain while urinating.

<p>If you notice a change in the color of your vaginal discharge, or if you experience severe cramps in your abdomen, rapid uterine contractions, or severe back pain, see a doctor immediately.</p>


What to do if you find brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy?
<p>If you notice brown discharge after sex, it is considered normal. Therefore, you may wear a sanitary pad for 1-2 days after sex to prevent staining your underwear. However, if your discharge changes to brown or contains blood after sex more than 2-3 times a month or more than 2 weeks, including the discharge has a strong odor and is accompanied by cramps, see a doctor immediately. Because these symptoms are signs of infection or other more serious symptoms. Initially, the doctor may do an ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis to make sure that the fetus is developing normally and does not have an infection. If the fetus is found to be healthy, the doctor may treat it with antibiotics or other medications to eliminate the <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/%e0%b9%80%e0%b8%8a%e0%b8%b7%e0%b9%89%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b2%e0%b9%83%e0%b8%99%e0%b8%8a%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%87%e0%b8%84%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%94" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >vaginal infection.</a> And you should closely monitor your symptoms and abstain from sex during this time.</p>
Let&#8217;s listen to what the doctor has to say!

<p>Although brown vaginal discharge during non-pregnancy or pregnancy is not a cause for concern and has a treatment, we would like all women to take care of and pay attention to what is happening to their bodies because sometimes it can be the key to being aware of serious diseases that are about to threaten you, for the health of the pregnancy and the health of the pregnant mother herself.</p>

Medically-related infections can cause brown vaginal discharge or vaginal bleeding. Some infections, such as gonorrhea or non-gonococcal urethritis, may not show symptoms in the early stages, but later on, there will be pain in the genitals while urinating, pelvic pain, and vaginal discharge that changes color, etc.</p>
<p>If I have brown vaginal discharge, should I see a doctor?<br />
In many cases, the brown discharge may be old blood that the body has expelled from the uterus to cleanse the uterus, especially at the beginning and end of the menstrual cycle. But don't forget to observe other symptoms if you feel any abnormalities in your body or you should see a doctor immediately if you feel that it is not discharge before or after your period because it may become a serious disease. You should see a doctor if you have the following symptoms along with brown discharge:</p>
<p>	Vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor or itching<br />
	Lower abdominal pain or pain during intercourse<br />
	Have a fever or other symptoms that are signs of infection.<br />
	There is a large amount of vaginal discharge or there is fresh blood mixed in.<br />
	Vaginal discharge lasts for more than 3 days.</p>
<p>What causes brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy?<br />
The reason why pregnant women have brown discharge, especially early pregnancy mothers, if they have brown discharge, it is usually due to irritation, increased hormones, and increased blood flow during pregnancy, which makes the cervix very fragile. Or having sex during pregnancy and a pelvic exam that may be harsh can also cause brown discharge. In addition, finding brown discharge during pregnancy near the end of pregnancy is a warning sign that the mother is about to give birth, no more than 2-3 weeks away, or some mothers may have it 2-3 days before the baby is born. In addition, mothers who are about to give birth may have symptoms such as bleeding from the vagina or blood mixed with the discharge. However, if you are not sure about the bleeding, consult a specialist immediately.<br />
Causes of brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy<br />
Pregnancy causes many changes in the body of a mother, including the occurrence of brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy. This is due to the change in pH in the female genital area, which may cause a small amount of vaginal discharge and is not a cause for much concern. The occurrence of brown vaginal discharge may occur for 2-3 days and then disappears naturally.<br />
Therefore, it is considered normal for pregnant women. Sometimes, there may be a little blood mixed in. This may be caused by the mother's physical activities, such as exercising, carrying heavy objects, cleaning the house too hard, or having sex. However, if you find that the discharge smells bad or feel a burning or itchy sensation in the vagina, it may be a symptom indicating a serious change, including:</p>
<p>	Infection: Because pregnant women are at higher risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases than normal women.<br />
	Risk of miscarriage. Most often, the risk of miscarriage occurs when the fetus is about 10 weeks old. Symptoms will occur suddenly and include a brown or red discharge from the vagina. Other symptoms include cramps or pain in the lower abdomen, blood clots in the vagina, dizziness, or fainting.<br />
	An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilized egg implants in a fallopian tube or into an ovary, abdomen, or cervix. This is called an ectopic pregnancy. In addition to brown discharge, an ectopic pregnancy may cause other symptoms, including sudden pain in the abdomen, pelvis, neck, and shoulders, pelvic pain on one side of the body, dizziness, or fainting.<br />
	Cervical infection  : When the cervix becomes inflamed for whatever reason, such as a bacterial infection, an allergy to feminine hygiene products, or a hormonal imbalance, pregnant women may experience the following symptoms: a large amount of vaginal discharge, which may have an odor, lower abdominal pain, vaginal pain, back pain, or pain while urinating.</p>
<p>If you notice a change in the color of your vaginal discharge, or if you experience severe cramps in your abdomen, rapid uterine contractions, or severe back pain, see a doctor immediately.</p>
<p>What to do if you find brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy?<br />
If you notice brown discharge after sex, it is considered normal. Therefore, you may wear a sanitary pad for 1-2 days after sex to prevent staining your underwear. However, if your discharge changes to brown or contains blood after sex more than 2-3 times a month or more than 2 weeks, including the discharge has a strong odor and is accompanied by cramps, see a doctor immediately. Because these symptoms are signs of infection or other more serious symptoms. Initially, the doctor may do an ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis to make sure that the fetus is developing normally and does not have an infection. If the fetus is found to be healthy, the doctor may treat it with antibiotics or other medications to eliminate the vaginal infection. And you should closely monitor your symptoms and abstain from sex during this time.<br />
Let's listen to what the doctor has to say!</p>
<p>Although brown vaginal discharge during non-pregnancy or pregnancy is not a cause for concern and has a treatment, we would like all women to take care of and pay attention to what is happening to their bodies because sometimes it can be the key to being aware of serious diseases that are about to threaten you, for the health of the pregnancy and the health of the pregnant mother herself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lower left abdominal pain Lower left abdominal pain Lower left abdominal pain Lower left abdominal pain Left abdominal pain Lower left abdominal pain during pregnancy, although it sounds worrisome, but in fact, it is a symptom that occurs frequently in pregnant mothers. If the pain is not severe or the symptoms only last for a short time, just change your position or get up to go to the bathroom and it goes away, then it is not a symptom to worry about. But if you feel severe abdominal pain, pregnant mothers must see a doctor immediately.</p>

<strong>Pregnant woman, pain in the left side of the abdomen, which organs are involved?</strong>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:339">Left abdominal pain during pregnancy can be related to multiple organs in the abdomen. Pregnant mothers should note the location of the pain (upper or lower abdomen) to help identify the cause of the pain, as this area contains several important organs. If you have pain, see a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment. The left abdomen can be divided into two main parts:</p>

<strong>Upper left abdomen:</strong> Contains organs such as the stomach, pancreas, spleen, and left kidney.
<strong>Lower left abdomen:</strong> Contains organs such as the uterus, left ovary, ureter, small intestine, and large intestine.


Pain in the left side of the abdomen radiating to the back, stabbing pain in the left side of the abdomen, stinging pain
<p>Left abdominal pain, left lower abdominal pain, back pain during pregnancy, <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/left-abdominal-pain-during-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >left lower abdominal pain, left lower abdominal pain,</a> back pain, left abdominal pain, pregnant women have lower left abdominal pain, stabbing pain, intermittent, may occur from the following causes:</p>
1. Pain in the lower left abdomen and pain in the right side of the uterus may be caused by a tilted uterus.
<p>When pregnant women feel <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/9-types-of-pain-in-pregnancy-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >pain in their abdomen</a> on the left side, it may be because your uterus is tilted to the right, causing the ligaments that hold the uterus on the left side to tighten. Mothers therefore feel pain from time to time, and the pain will be worse when they laugh or move quickly. Sometimes this symptom will spread to the groin area. To relieve this pain, mothers may have to fix it by moving slowly or consulting a doctor to find a way to help relieve the pain from the doctor.</p>
2. Pain in the left abdominal cavity, pain in the lower left abdominal cavity, pregnant women have pain in the lower left abdominal cavity, stabbing pain that comes and goes, ovarian cysts or ovarian cysts.
<p>If you feel pain in the lower left abdomen, which is the location of your ovaries, you may have an ovarian cyst. The reason is that during pregnancy, the ovarian cyst continues to produce a group of tissue called the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone and estrogen. Ovarian cysts occur from the accumulation of fluid in the corpus luteum. In some cases, it can go away on its own without treatment. In some cases, if the cyst continues to grow larger, it can cause problems later. In the case of pregnant women, if the cyst is hidden behind the uterus, it may be difficult to detect. And if this ovarian cyst continues to grow larger, it may be difficult for you to give birth because the cyst blocks the birth canal.</p>
<p>Symptoms of ovarian cysts are as follows:</p>

stomach ache
Left abdominal pain
I have pain in my left abdomen, it is sharp and comes and goes.
Pain in the left abdomen radiating to the back
Frequent urination
Lower abdominal pain and back pain
Abnormal bleeding



3. Pain in the lower left abdomen, digestive system
<p>During pregnancy, the body&#8217;s hormones are constantly changing. Sometimes, it can affect the digestive system, causing <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/10-foods-that-cause-gas-240620" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >gas in the stomach</a> and <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/8-constipation-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >constipation,</a> which may be one of the reasons why you feel pain in the left side of your stomach.</p>
<p>However, pain in the left side of the abdomen is not only caused by pregnancy. It may also occur due to physical illnesses such as pancreatitis or gallstones. Pancreatitis causes pain in the middle of the abdomen or more to the left side, and symptoms usually appear after the mother eats very greasy foods or when lying on her back.</p>
4. Pain in the left abdomen, colic in the left abdomen, pain in the left abdomen, stabbing pain on and off, ectopic pregnancy.
<p>Lower left abdominal pain Ectopic pregnancy is another cause of pain in the left side of the abdomen. This symptom will not appear in the first weeks of pregnancy. The cause of ectopic pregnancy is the implantation of the fertilized egg outside the uterus. It usually implants in the fallopian tube. If the embryo is allowed to grow until the fallopian tube ruptures, the mother will be at risk of bleeding and may lead to death. Most doctors will terminate the pregnancy to save the mother&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy include the following:</p>

Pain in the abdomen or lower abdomen that is a squeezing sensation that comes and goes.
There is pain radiating to the shoulder and chest pain.
Lower back pain
Vaginal bleeding
Some people also feel dizzy and feel like they are going to faint.



What is the cause of the pain in the lower left abdomen during pregnancy?


Pain in the lower left abdomen, severe cramps in the abdomen


<p class="p1">Severe cramping pain in the abdomen that lasts for several hours, sometimes accompanied by bleeding, while sometimes not, may be a sign of miscarriage or premature placental abruption.</p>


Pregnant woman has pain in lower left abdomen, sharp pain


<p>A stabbing or dull pain in the lower abdomen, similar to menstrual pain, that occurs without vaginal bleeding is a common symptom during the 4th to 5th month of pregnancy. This symptom is mainly caused by the stretching of the uterine ligaments, as the uterus expands rapidly during this time. When the ligaments stretch and become tight, it causes pain. Advice for mothers is to sit and rest, move slowly, and avoid hard work, including going up and down the stairs.</p>

Pregnant women can observe the following other symptoms:</p>

Amidst the many beliefs and recommendations about pregnancy food, the question on many mothers’ minds is “What do pregnant women eat to make their babies smart?” or “Is there really the best food for brain development in the fetus?” While some pregnant mothers may be concerned about their own food and nutrition during pregnancy because what the mother eats will be passed on to the fetus. Today, let’s see what kind of food helps make babies smart. <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/the-best-foods-for-baby-brain-development-140420" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >What do pregnant women eat to make their babies smart?</a> If you’re ready, let’s take a look.</p>



What nutrients are there to nourish the brain of a baby in the womb?

<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:246">During pregnancy, your body needs additional nutrients to support your baby&#8217;s growth and development. Your baby&#8217;s brain starts developing from the early stages of pregnancy, so getting the right nutrients is crucial for your baby&#8217;s healthy brain development.</p>
<strong>Important nutrients that nourish your baby&#8217;s brain</strong>

<strong>Folate</strong> : Plays a key role in the formation of a baby&#8217;s neural tube, reduces the risk of birth defects in the brain and spinal cord, and promotes overall brain health. Found in green leafy vegetables, soybeans, liver, egg yolks, and citrus fruits.
<strong>Omega-3 fatty acids</strong> : are important components of brain and retinal cells, aiding in brain development, learning and memory in infants. Found in salmon, tuna, mackerel, flaxseeds and walnuts. Omega-3 fatty acids
<strong>Iodine</strong> : Essential for the development of the baby&#8217;s brain and nervous system. If the mother does not get enough iodine, it may affect the child&#8217;s intellectual development. Found in sea salt, tuna, milk and eggs.
<strong>Iron</strong> : Found in meat, soybeans, green leafy vegetables and grains, it helps in the production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the brain and other parts of the baby&#8217;s body. A lack of iron can affect brain development.
<strong>Zinc</strong> : Found in meat, peanuts, oats, and pumpkin seeds, zinc is important for brain development and immune system function.

1. Salmon fillet
<p>For moms who like to eat salmon , congratulations. Salmon has a very high level of omega  3 and also has iodine, which is beneficial to the body and thyroid glands of moms.

<p><a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/is-it-safe-to-take-painkillers-during-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Can pregnant women with toothaches</a> take painkillers like everyone else before seeing a dentist? And if they do, will painkillers affect the baby in the womb? When many people feel toothache, the first thing they think of is to take painkillers such as paracetamol or aspirin to relieve the symptoms first. But what about pregnant women? Is it possible to take these medications? What should pregnant women do if they have toothaches? What medicines can pregnant women take if they have wisdom teeth, swollen gums, or molars? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
Tooth sensitivity during pregnancy
<p>During pregnancy, you will experience many discomforts. Your body will change, so you may experience back pain or discomfort. However, while you are trying to prop yourself up with a high pillow to sleep better, you may notice that another source of discomfort for pregnant women is your teeth. You may experience sensitive teeth during pregnancy, but if you know that other pregnant women experience the same symptoms, you may feel relieved. Here are some of the reasons why pregnant women may experience sensitive teeth and sore gums, and how to deal with these symptoms safely.</p>


Reasons why pregnant women have toothaches. Relieve toothaches in 1 minute.
<p>During pregnancy, from the 2nd month onwards, there will be more blood vessels feeding the gums than usual. This makes it easy for pregnant women to have gingivitis and it is more likely to be inflamed than usual. Pregnant women can have gum disease ranging from simple gingivitis to periodontitis or gingivitis, which is inflammation of the gums along with inflammation of the periodontal ligament, root coating, and alveolar bone. The reason why pregnant women have toothaches and tooth decay may be due to eating habits that are more frequent during pregnancy, which causes food particles to stick to the teeth. If you don’t brush your teeth every time after eating, it will make it easier for mothers to have tooth decay and toothache.</p>
1. High progesterone hormone
<p>When a new mother is pregnant, hormonal changes in the body can cause gum inflammation and easy bleeding, making it impossible for the mother to brush her teeth properly because she will feel pain in her mouth. What inevitably follows is toothache.</p>
2. Eat often
<p>Expectant mothers tend to eat more frequently than normal people, which causes food particles to get stuck between their teeth. Especially if they don&#8217;t brush their teeth after every meal, and some may already have pain due to the first reason, toothache and tooth decay are not difficult to find.</p>
3. Stomach acid
<p>People who experience morning sickness and vomiting will also have stomach acid coming out. This acid will erode the teeth, causing tooth decay. Finally, there will be a lot of bacteria in the mouth, which can also pass on germs to the baby in the womb.</p>

Just pound the morning glory roots until fine, squeeze out the juice, and mix with vinegar. Then hold it in your mouth for about 5 minutes, then spit it out.

6. Try not to take painkillers.
<p>Mothers must be very careful about this. If you don&#8217;t feel the pain is too much or you can still tolerate it, you should avoid taking any type of medication, especially during the first 8-10 weeks of pregnancy because this is the period when the baby&#8217;s brain, lungs, and heart are developing. Taking certain types of medication can cause the baby&#8217;s organs to develop abnormally. However, you should always consult a doctor if you have to take any type of medication.</p>


Pregnant women with toothaches take paracetamol and toothache medicine. How does this affect the baby?

Infants are about 29% more likely to develop <a class="tm-link-tag" href="https://th.theasianparent.com/asthma-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >asthma</a> as they age than infants who did not receive medication in the womb.

How does a pregnant woman&#8217;s tooth decay affect her baby in the womb?

<strong>Premature birth</strong> Oral infections such as gingivitis or untreated tooth decay can cause inflammation that affects the hormones that regulate birth, increasing the risk of preterm birth.
<strong>Low birth weight.</strong> An infection in your mother&#8217;s mouth can cause your baby to be underweight, which can affect your baby&#8217;s development after birth.
<strong>Transmission of germs:</strong> Bacteria that are caused by tooth decay can spread into the mother&#8217;s bloodstream and affect the baby&#8217;s immune system.


Pregnant women have tooth decay. What should they do? How should they take care of themselves to keep their baby safe?
<p>What do pregnant women do to prevent tooth decay? Before tooth decay becomes a chronic problem affecting both the mother and the little member about to be born, all mothers should prevent this disease by brushing their teeth regularly every day, morning and before bed (or if possible, brush after 3 meals). You should brush for 2 minutes each time. Use dental floss to help in areas where a toothbrush cannot reach. Choose a toothpaste that contains fluoride because fluoride helps prevent tooth enamel decay and increases the tooth enamel&#8217;s resistance to acid.</p>
<p>In addition, mothers should not eat food that is too hard, including food that is very hot or very cold because it will cause the loss of tooth enamel. And should inform the dentist about the toothache in the most detail so that treatment can be given early and will help reduce the possible dangers.</p>
<p>However, the best way to treat toothache is to prevent it from happening by taking care of your mouth and teeth to be clean and good at all times, such as brushing your teeth at least twice a day, flossing to remove food particles and plaque, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular dental checkups for good oral health.</p>

            <media:text type="plain"><![CDATA[<p>Can pregnant women with toothaches take painkillers like everyone else before seeing a dentist? And if they do, will painkillers affect the baby in the womb? When many people feel toothache, the first thing they think of is to take painkillers such as paracetamol or aspirin to relieve the symptoms first. But what about pregnant women? Is it possible to take these medications? What should pregnant women do if they have toothaches? What medicines can pregnant women take if they have wisdom teeth, swollen gums, or molars? Let's find out.<br />
Tooth sensitivity during pregnancy<br />
During pregnancy, you will experience many discomforts. Your body will change, so you may experience back pain or discomfort. However, while you are trying to prop yourself up with a high pillow to sleep better, you may notice that another source of discomfort for pregnant women is your teeth. You may experience sensitive teeth during pregnancy, but if you know that other pregnant women experience the same symptoms, you may feel relieved. Here are some of the reasons why pregnant women may experience sensitive teeth and sore gums, and how to deal with these symptoms safely.</p>
<p>Reasons why pregnant women have toothaches. Relieve toothaches in 1 minute.<br />
During pregnancy, from the 2nd month onwards, there will be more blood vessels feeding the gums than usual. This makes it easy for pregnant women to have gingivitis and it is more likely to be inflamed than usual. Pregnant women can have gum disease ranging from simple gingivitis to periodontitis or gingivitis, which is inflammation of the gums along with inflammation of the periodontal ligament, root coating, and alveolar bone. The reason why pregnant women have toothaches and tooth decay may be due to eating habits that are more frequent during pregnancy, which causes food particles to stick to the teeth. If you don’t brush your teeth every time after eating, it will make it easier for mothers to have tooth decay and toothache.<br />
1. High progesterone hormone<br />
When a new mother is pregnant, hormonal changes in the body can cause gum inflammation and easy bleeding, making it impossible for the mother to brush her teeth properly because she will feel pain in her mouth. What inevitably follows is toothache.<br />
2. Eat often<br />
Expectant mothers tend to eat more frequently than normal people, which causes food particles to get stuck between their teeth. Especially if they don't brush their teeth after every meal, and some may already have pain due to the first reason, toothache and tooth decay are not difficult to find.<br />
3. Stomach acid<br />
People who experience morning sickness and vomiting will also have stomach acid coming out. This acid will erode the teeth, causing tooth decay. Finally, there will be a lot of bacteria in the mouth, which can also pass on germs to the baby in the womb.</p>

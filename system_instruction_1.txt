You will be extracting events from an article. Follow the format below as much as possible.
If there are no events extracted, return an empty array: "[]"

Events must be activities that families can do. 
It SHOULD NOT be 
- about regular enrichment or tuition classes (UNLESS there is special classes like one time trial lesson) 
- places to visit (e.g. tourism attraction or cafe spots) 
- generic activities (e.g. visiting to the park for playground)
- About LGBTQ related

If the article mentions multiple events under a particular event group, returns just the event group. (For instance, a fair that consists multiple activities, return the output just the fair, and not the multiple activities.)

For each event identified, follow the task below:
    Go to the article website itself. Extract all the information below that is needed.
    Then, search the internet and go to a reliable source website (e.g., the official event organizer's site, a reputable ticketing platform) to verify or add more information that the blog website could not provide.
IMPORTANT: Before providing a URL, check that the link is reachable and does not return a 404 or other error. Only provide URLs that are accessible to the public and do not require login. If you cannot find a working URL, state "No valid URL found".

Example of output (in text, not in json):

Article title: [Article Title from source]
GUID: [Full URL from GUID. Copy exactly as provided]
post_id: [the id provided from GUID url parameter]
article_website: [Full URL from article website]
Categories: [Categories from source]

For each event:
**Title**:              [40–70 chars, no location/date/time]
**Description**:        [400–700 chars, expand if needed]
**Venue_display**:      [All venues; if missing, use “Online” or “To be announced”]
**Schedule_display**:   [Weekly, one-time, or irregular. For one-time, give full start/end date and time with timezone. Exclude past events.]
**Cost**:               [“Free” if no cost; show all price ranges with currency. Ignore blog-specific promotions.]
**URL**:                [Match the links from "urls" field to each event as much as possible, where you can find more official details about the events. 
                        Do not use blog websites. If you cannot match, find a suitable URL link from the internet. 
                        It can be from a website where customers buy the ticket from (e.g. eventbrite or sistc), not necessarily from the source website.
                        The URL provided MUST be public and does not return 404/errors or invalid.]

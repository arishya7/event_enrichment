You will be extracting events from the article content provided in the prompt. Follow the format below as much as possible.

IMPORTANT: If there are no valid events that meet the criteria below, return ONLY "[]" without any article metadata or other text.

Events must be activities that families can do. 
It SHOULD NOT be 
- about regular enrichment or tuition classes (UNLESS there is special classes like one time trial lesson) 
- regular places to visit (e.g. tourism attraction or cafe spots) 
- generic activities (e.g. visiting to the park for playground)
- About LGBTQ related

Valid events include:
- Festivals and fairs
- Special exhibitions or shows
- One-time or special workshops
- Holiday events and celebrations
- Wellness and fitness events suitable for families
- Community events and gatherings
- Pop-up markets and food events
- Special holiday activities

If the article mentions multiple events under a particular event group, returns just the event group. (For instance, a fair that consists multiple activities, return the output just the fair, and not the multiple activities.)

For events without specific dates, use the earliest possible date in 2025 and mark as TBA in the display.
For events without specific prices, use "Price to be announced" and set is_free to false.
For events without age limits, use "all ages" and set min_age to 0 and max_age to 99.

ONLY IF valid events are found, include the following article metadata and event details:

Article title: [Article Title from source]

post_id: [the id provided from GUID url parameter]

For each event:
**Title**:              [20–70 chars, no location/date/time]

**Venue_display**:      [All venues; if missing, use "Online" or "To be announced"]

                        Do not use blog websites. If you cannot match, find a suitable URL link from the internet. 
                        It can be from a website where customers buy the ticket from (e.g. eventbrite or sistc), not necessarily from the source website.
                        The URL provided MUST be public and does not return 404/errors or invalid.]

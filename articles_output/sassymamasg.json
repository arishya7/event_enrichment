Life can hit us hard sometimes, and it’s okay to ask for help! Whatever your mental health struggles are, know that you’re not alone and there’s much to be gained from counselling or therapy in Singapore. Counselling services can help you if you’re on the lookout for marriage counselling ( this couple found having a child with autism put a strain on their marriage ), or whether you’d like to speak to a therapist to help with your self-worth, counselling for postpartum depression , a listening ear for your child or teen, or just someone to help your family navigate life harmoniously. Jump to: – Counselling, therapy, psychology: know the different terms – Where to find counselling services in SG Counsellor, Psychologist, Psychotherapist: Know the Difference Confused about the differences between a psychotherapist and a psychologist, counselling or therapy? Here’s a simple breakdown to get you started. Counselling vs. therapy: These terms are often used interchangeably, but typically, counselling focuses on problem-solving specific issues that are happening to you in the present and is usually applied for shorter terms than therapy. Psychotherapy: This long-term, in-depth solution zooms into a wider range of issues, and involves dissecting your past experiences and childhood to find answers for your current behavioural patterns and issues. Psychotherapist: This umbrella term applies to any professional trained to treat people for their mental health, and can encompass psychiatrists, counsellors and clinical psychologists. Psychiatrists: These mental health experts have a medical degree and specialise in preventing, diagnosing, and treating mental illness. Unlike most psychotherapists, they can also prescribe medication. Psychologists: They usually have a Master’s Degree or PhD in psychology and talk therapy. They perform psychological testing and are qualified to do counselling and psychotherapy for mental disorders. A counselling psychologist will tend to work with clients with emotional and social issues, whereas a clinical psychologist will normally work with people suffering from more complex mental health conditions, such as personality disorders and major depressive disorders. Counsellors: They typically help clients explore the challenges or difficulties being faced, whether it’s dissatisfaction with life or even a loss of purpose.

    "content": "Hari Raya Haji 2025 falls on 7 June 2025. Here’s all you need to know about the significance of Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji, and how they’re celebrated in Singapore. “Wait, it’s Hari Raya again? Didn’t we just celebrate it two months ago?” and “Why are there two Hari Raya celebrations in a year?” are probably common questions you’ll see every year. Hari Raya Puasa or Hari Raya Aidilfitri falls on 31 March 2025, and this festival celebrates the end of the month of Ramadan , AKA the Islamic holy month of fasting. Not to be confused with Hari Raya Haji, which is referred to as the Festival of Sacrifice. Hari Raya Haji falls on 7 June 2025! Here’s a lowdown of all you need to know about these two special days, and how it’s celebrated by Muslims in Singapore Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri Image credit: MUIS via Instagram Also known as Eid al-Fitr, Hari Raya Puasa marks the end of the Islamic month of Ramadan and is one of the most important celebrations of the year. “Puasa” means fasting, and during Ramadan, Muslims around the world fast from dawn to sunset. But fasting isn’t just about abstaining from food and drink (yes, even water!), it’s a spiritual practice that promotes self-discipline, empathy for the less fortunate, and a deeper connection with God. There is no fixed date on the Gregorian calendar for both Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji. Like all Islamic festivals, the dates for Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji are based on astronomical calculations that rely on the sighting of the new moon. Because of this Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji differ from year to year. In Singapore, the Islamic Religious Council (known in Malay as Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura, or MUIS) is responsible for determining the date of the festival each year.

Hari Raya Haji (which means “great day of the haj ” in Malay), also known as Aidiladha (also spelt Eid al-Adha or Eid Adha) or the Great Day of Sacrifice, is a Muslim festival that falls on the 10th day of Zulhijjah (the 12th month in the Islamic calendar). Hari Raya Haji also coincides with the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, a significant event for Muslims worldwide and also one of the Five Pillars of Islam. What’s the difference between Hari Raya Haji and Hari Raya Puasa? Image credit: Visit Singapore Hari Raya Puasa aka Eid-ul-Fitr was celebrated on 31 March 2025 and signified the end of the fasting month of Ramadan , while Hari Raya Haji (7 June 2025) is celebrated to mark the Muslim pilgrimage (hajj), and is a day when Muslims usually perform the annual ‘korban’ ritual. Read more: Guide To Halal Restaurants & Cafés Are Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji public holidays in Singapore? Yes, Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji are designated as public holidays in Singapore . What is the ‘korban’ ritual? Hari Raya Haji commemorates the willingness of the Islamic prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son Ismail in an act of obedience to God. The korban is one of the main rituals and involves the sacrificial slaughtering of livestock such as cows, sheep or goats. The sacrifice ritual is done quickly (the jugular vein at the animal’s throat is slit quickly to ensure the quickest death possible), then the meat is cleaned and distributed to the community, the poor and needy. How is Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji celebrated in Singapore? Image credit: Visit Singapore Hari Raya Puasa: In Singapore, Hari Raya Puasa is a vibrant celebration, with Muslim families donning their finest colourful ethnic costumes as they spend the day visiting loved ones. The festival emphasises unity, forgiveness, and the importance of family. The day kicks off with special prayers at the mosque, followed by a sermon. You’ll also see Ramadan bazaars popping up around Singapore during the month of Ramadan leading up to Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri, including the biggest bazaar in Geylang Serai . These bazaars will consist of delicious food, Hari Raya goodies, festive costumes, performances and much more. Hari Raya Haji: Besides the korban ritual on Hari Raya Haji, Muslims usually congregate to perform Hari Raya Haji prayers in the morning at the mosque and then visit close family members just like they do during Hari Raya Puasa. Muslims use it as an opportunity to gather and strengthen family bonds. No Hari Raya celebration is complete without the delicious festive food! Expect a spread of festive dishes like ketupat (rice cakes), rendang (spicy meat stew), ayam masak merah (chicken in spicy tomato paste), and more. For sweet treats, every home you visit will be filled with a variety of goodies, with favourites like Makmur, Suji, and Kueh Tart.

You will help me format the events in a more structure schema. Rephrase all the text for description as much as possible, but retain the information as accurate as possible.
If you see multiple events that is under one event (for instance, multiple activities at a fair, or multiple locations for a same event), group them into one event. 
Any values you are not sure with, put a string of NULL.
For any string requires datetime, ensure that it ends in the future. If start and end date does not specify, put NULL
For URL, extract from source website, not the GUID URL.
Criteria to skip events:
- Promoting regular businesses (no promotion or special events)
- Enrichment classes (regular ones without noting special ocasion or events)
- Shops selling products (without any activities or events)
- Mentions sassymamasg, honeykidsasia, thesmartlocal
- Events that mention LGBTQ or adult content

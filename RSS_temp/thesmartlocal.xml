										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>Travelling in a group with friends</b></h2>
<hr />
<p>We’ve all heard of that infamous getaway that somehow made it out of the group chat, only for friendships to come back on life support. Turns out, squeezing 6 different personalities into 1 itinerary isn’t always the recipe for a relaxing time &#8211; and we get it. To help you keep the good vibes going, we’ve put together a guide to <strong>travelling in a group with friends</strong>, including apps that’ll save you from <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/travel-mistakes-holiday/">travel mistakes</a>, tips for handling drama, and the subtle red flags you <i>defo</i> don’t wanna ignore.</p>

<hr />
<h3><b>What’s it like travelling with friends?</b></h3>
<hr />
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362567" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-26.png" alt="Guy solo travelling" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-26.png 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-26-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-26-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-26-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Some people love the freedom of <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/solo-travel-near-singapore/">solo travel</a> &#8211; no need to wait for anyone, no drama, and you get to do whatever you want, whenever you want. But most of us start spiralling the moment we have to eat alone or take a selfie with our phone propped up on a water bottle.</p>
<p>If the thought of asking a stranger to help take a photo gives you the ick, then travelling with friends might just be more your thing. You’ll never have to eat alone, there’s someone to hype you up during photoshoots, it’s generally safer, and splitting the costs is always a win for the wallet.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362571" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-30.png" alt="Friends scuba diving" width="1280" height="856" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-30.png 1280w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-30-300x201.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-30-1024x685.png 1024w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-30-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-30-768x514.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Of course, it’s not always sunshine and rainbows. Decision fatigue is real when you’re choosing between 5 <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/tags/cafes/">cafes</a> for brunch, and money matters can get awkward when someone suddenly develops amnesia during bill-splitting time. There’ll also be times when you just want to chill, but someone else is already shaking you awake at 6am for a sunrise <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/tags/hiking/">hike</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t let the chaos scare you off, though &#8211; with a little teamwork, clear communication, and the occasional compromise, the trip doesn’t have to end in tears and unfollows. It can still be the core memory you hoped for.</p>

<p>Universal experience: sitting at a restaurant table post-meal, trying to figure out who owes what, and ending up more confused than when you started.<b> Splitwise</b> (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/splitwise/id458023433" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Splitwise.SplitwiseMobile&amp;hl=en_SG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>) is a free expense-splitting app that does all the math for you, so there’s no need to whip out calculators.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362562" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-21.png" alt="Settle up in Splitwise app" width="325" height="486" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-21.png 325w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-21-201x300.png 201w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-21-100x150.png 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /><br />

<p>It’s one of the more popular apps out there for a reason. All you have to do is get everyone on the trip to download the app and join your group. Then, start adding expenses in any currency as you go. The app tracks everything and tells each person exactly how much they owe and to whom. Tap “settle up” once the money has changed hands.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362582" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-10.jpg" alt="Splitwise Pro" width="369" height="800" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-10.jpg 369w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-10-138x300.jpg 138w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-10-69x150.jpg 69w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px" /><br />

<p><b>Pro tip</b>: Splitwise recently introduced a new update that limits how many expenses you can add at a time. We tried it out and got hit with a 10-second cooldown timer after 2 entries. Slightly annoying, but not enough to derail your trip. The trick is to make your friend input the next expense.</p>
<p>Alternatively, consider upgrading to the Pro version at <b>$29.98/year</b> for your first year, then <b>$59.98/year </b>after that for unlimited entries.</p>

<h3><b>2. Settle Up</b></h3>

<h4><b>Split group expenses without having everybody download the app</b></h4>

<p>The thought of forcing all your friends to download yet another app sounds like a headache, but <b>Settle Up</b> (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/settle-up-group-expenses/id737534985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.destil.settleup&amp;hl=en_SG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>) doesn’t require everyone to sign up &#8211; only 1 person needs to download it and set things up. So if you’re the planner of the group trip, AKA the person who made the itinerary and purchased the <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/annual-travel-insurance-singapore/">travel insurance</a>, you might as well add this to your to-do list.</p>
<p>Once you’ve downloaded the app, create a group, add everyone’s names, and start tracking daily expenses. Settle Up will do the rest, like crunching the numbers and letting you know exactly who owes what to whom.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362557" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-16.jpg" alt="Settle Up share with friends" width="1726" height="969" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-16.jpg 1726w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-16-300x168.jpg 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-16-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-16-150x84.jpg 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-16-768x431.jpg 768w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-16-1536x862.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1726px) 100vw, 1726px" /><br />
<i>Image credit: Settle Up</i></p>
<p>Share the group link with your friends, and they’ll be able to view the breakdown on their browser without downloading the app.</p>
<p>It’s free, but you’ll get the occasional ad &#8211; we got 1 after entering 3 expenses. Not a dealbreaker, but for an ad-free experience, go Premium for <b>$5.98/month</b> or <b>$28.98/year</b>. Or just activate it during travel season and cancel it after.</p>

You’ll get to build and share detailed itineraries, plot everything out on an in-app map, and even access your plans offline &#8211; all without paying a cent.</p>

<p>The app pulls info directly from Google, so when you key in a location, it auto-fills the <i>deets </i>like opening hours, addresses, and reviews. No more hopping between tabs or copy-pasting links into your group chat. It also lets you manage and split expenses within the app, which is great news for those who would rather not deal with yet another download just to track who owes what.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362555" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-14.jpg" alt="Wanderlog in-app map" width="716" height="716" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-14.jpg 716w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-14-300x300.jpg 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-14-150x150.jpg 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-14-65x65.jpg 65w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-14-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" /><br />

<p>While the offline maps are a Pro feature, the free version still lets you view your itinerary on the go. There’s also a paid upgrade from <b>$18.90</b> that gives you extras like route optimisation and Google Maps export &#8211; it’s handy for overachievers, but TBH, the free version already covers most travel needs.</p>
<hr />
<h3><b>4. Google Maps</b></h3>
<hr />
<h4><b>Completely free to use with a comprehensive map coverage</b></h4>
<hr />
<p>We all use <a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Google Maps</b></a> to get from Point A to B, but it’s also a great itinerary planning tool that’s completely free. Beyond just navigation, it also lets you pin and save places you want to visit, colour-code them into neat little categories, and view everything at a glance on 1 map. It also gives you real-time traffic updates and reviews of attractions, so you’ll know if that “hidden gem” is actually worth the detour.</p>

<p>Need to plot out your whole journey? <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Google My Maps</b></a> is a more detailed version that lets you customise routes, add waypoints, and share the map with your travel buddies so everyone stays on the same page.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center"><b>&#8211; For making group decisions &#8211;</b></h3>
<hr />
<h3><b>5. WhatsApp/Telegram</b></h3>
<hr />
<h4><b>Create polls for voting purposes</b></h4>
<hr />
<p>You probably already have 1 or both of these apps on your phone, but they’re not just for spamming memes and stalking blue ticks. <b>WhatsApp</b> (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp&amp;hl=en_SG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>) and <b>Telegram </b>(<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger&amp;hl=en_SG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>) actually let you create polls in group chats, great for when your travel group can’t decide on anything.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362575" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-3.jpg" alt="Telegram poll" width="591" height="1280" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-3.jpg 591w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-3-139x300.jpg 139w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-3-473x1024.jpg 473w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-3-69x150.jpg 69w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /><br />

<p>Use them to settle major debates like which country to go to, what time to book that flight, or whether it’s vibes over value when picking a <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/category/things-to-do/hotels-staycations/">hotel</a>. You can even get into the petty but necessary stuff, like whether latecomers deserve a grace period or a passive-aggressive glare.</p>
<p>You won’t have to screenshot every opinion and manually tally responses like it’s 2008. Just send a poll, let the people vote, and move on. Group trips run smoother when decisions don’t end in “up to you <i>lah</i>”.</p>

<p>Only 1 person needs to download the app and generate a QR code. Your friends can scan it to join the album, then start snapping pics from their own POV. You get to decide how many shots each person gets, and the gallery will only be revealed after a customisable waiting time. No peeking allowed till then, which makes looking back at the photos even more satisfying.</p>
<p>It’s also a lifesaver for mixed-brand friend groups &#8211; everything’s in 1 shared album, no matter what phone you use.</p>

<h3><b>How to avoid travel drama during group travel</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>Even with an arsenal of apps, it’s inevitable that disagreements arise. After all, <i>we’re only human</i> (channelling Christina Perri with a dramatic stare out the plane window).</p>
<p>Here’s how to avoid turning your holiday into a soft launch of a friendship breakup.</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>Have candid money talks before the trip</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362564" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-23.png" alt="Counting money" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-23.png 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-23-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-23-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-23-768x512.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Nothing kills the fun faster than someone gasping at dinner prices or ghosting when it’s time to split the bill. That’s why it’s so important to <b>have the money talk before the trip</b>, even if it feels a bit awkward.</p>
<p>Be upfront about your spending comfort zone, and ask the group what they’re okay with. Are we <i>ballin’ </i>on a budget? Street food or fancy omakase? It’s not about shaming anyone, but more of setting expectations so no one’s caught off guard mid-trip.</p>
<p>Once everyone’s on the same page, you’ll avoid <i>paggro </i>moments and enjoy the holiday without financial tension lurking in the group chat.</p>
<p>It also helps to sort out things like how much cash to carry. Are you going to pool a group stash, or is it every man for himself?</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>Assign roles for each friend</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362569" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-28.jpg" alt="Singapore passport" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-28.jpg 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-28-150x100.jpg 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-28-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Instead of having everyone Googling directions at the same time, <b>assign each person a role</b> like it’s a group project.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Navigator:</b> lives on Google Maps and knows which bus to take, how many stops, and where to transfer.</li>
<li><b>The Treasurer:</b> keeps track of everything and logs it into the expense-splitting app so no one goes home broke or bitter.</li>
<li><b>The Timekeeper: </b>not just a human alarm clock &#8211; also picks people off the bed, watches the time during pit stops, and gives countdowns so you don’t miss flights or reservations.</li>
<li><b>The Admin: </b>handles bookings, reservations, and screenshots every confirmation email like a pro.</li>
<li><b>The Vibes Manager: </b>the most underrated role &#8211; whips out snacks during meltdowns, plays the right tunes when everyone’s grumpy, and cracks jokes at just the right moment.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><b>Don’t force togetherness</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362572" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-31.png" alt="Girl alone in Greece" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-31.png 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-31-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-31-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-31-768x512.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Newsflash: just because you’re travelling as a group doesn’t mean you need to be glued together 24/7. Understand that different people have different interests, so it’s <b>perfectly fine to split up for activities</b>.</p>
<p>Suggest a simple plan, like doing your own thing in the day, then regrouping for dinner or hangouts later. You’ll avoid unnecessary tension and have more stories to share.</p>
<p>This also means you don’t have to cram everyone’s wishlist into 1 chaotic itinerary. Less stress, more freedom, and no one has to suffer through activities they’re secretly not into. It’s a holiday, not a hostage situation.</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>Schedule downtime</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362570" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-29.png" alt="Friends drinking together" width="999" height="666" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-29.png 999w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-29-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-29-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-29-768x512.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px" /></p>
<p>There’s always that friend who wants to carpe diem from dawn till dusk &#8211; but not everyone’s idea of a good time involves sprinting from one place to another.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you just want to <i>nua </i>in the hotel room. That’s why it’s a must to <b>slot in some proper free-and-easy time</b> in your itinerary for naps, solo exploring, or just doing absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Well-rested friends are less likely to snap over where to eat. It really makes a difference in keeping the group sane and the vibes immaculate.</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>Agree on a “post later, live now” pact</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362559" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-18.png" alt="Girl using her phone" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-18.png 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-18-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-18-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-18-768x512.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>“Pics or it didn’t happen”, but if the group’s been stuck in the same pose for 20 minutes because someone needs 37 angles, mutiny is inevitable.</p>
<p>To avoid becoming that friend, <b>agree on some boundaries</b>. Snap your pics in the first 10 minutes, then move on and actually enjoy the moment. No need to force everyone to stand around while you edit your IG story or pick the perfect caption &#8211; that can wait till you’re back at the hotel in your PJs.</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>Remind yourself, “it’s not that deep”</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362568" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-27.png" alt="Friends on a road trip" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-27.png 1280w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-27-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-27-1024x682.png 1024w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-27-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-27-768x512.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Missed the bus? A friend used your expensive shampoo without asking? Unless it&#8217;s life-threatening, tell yourself: “<b>It’s not that deep.</b>” The best stories always come from the dumbest travel hiccups anyway.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/nostalgic-drinks-singapore/">nostalgic drinks</a>, Anything and Whatever? Cute. But when your friend turns into a real-life version of that, not so cute. You’ll spend 45 minutes crowding around Google Maps trying to pick a lunch spot because <b>they refuse to choose</b>, but also don’t like anything you suggest. Bonus points if they say “up to you all <i>lah</i>” and then still look upset the whole meal.</p>
<p>If this sounds like someone in your group, send this to them with love and maybe gently nudge them to, quite literally, pick anything next time.</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>The budget </b><b><i>sabo</i></b> <b><i>kia</i></b></h4>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362574" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-2.png" alt="Friends saving money" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-2.png 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-2-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-2-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-2-768x512.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>You all agreed on a budget trip, but this one <b>suddenly wants expensive dinners, private tours, and luxury hotels</b>. They may also say things like: “YOLO right?” and “I don’t mind topping up.” Sorry, you might not mind, but the rest of us didn’t budget for a bougie lifestyle on a tiny salary.</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>The MIA traveller</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><b>No message, no update</b> &#8211; just <i>poof</i>. Then they reappear hours later, shocked and appalled that the group didn’t wait for them to go cafe hopping or catch the sunset.</p>
<p>Look, everyone deserves alone time. But at the very least, just drop a quick text in the chat. No one’s trying to track your every move, we just don’t want to file a missing person report in a foreign country.</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>The complainer</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362560" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-19.jpg" alt="Friend complaining to another friend" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-19.jpg 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-19-150x100.jpg 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-19-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Too hot. Too cold. Too much walking. Too little to see. And the list goes on. This person somehow finds a way to <b>complain about everything</b>. The worst part is that their energy is contagious, and not in a good way.</p>
<p>Don’t be that person. Not every moment of a trip will be 5 stars, but constant complaining is how group trips turn sour real quick.</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>The drama magnet</b></h4>
<hr />
<p>Every small issue has the <b>possibility to turn into World War III</b>, and travelling with them feels like being in an episode of <i>Keeping Up with the Kiasu-dians</i>. Somehow, you’re always the unwilling co-star.</p>
<p>We’re all bound to have a moment or 2 on a trip, but if someone’s default mode is chaos, it might be time for a gentle intervention.</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>The oversleeper</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362583" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-11.png" alt="Girl sleeping" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-11.png 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-11-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-11-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Travelling-with-friends-11-768x512.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Despite multiple alarms and wake-up calls, they <b>cannot get out of bed</b>. Missed the hike. Missed the ferry. Almost missed the flight. They’ve probably said: “5 more minutes please&#8230;” while the rest of the group stood outside the hotel room, silently plotting their revenge.</p>
<p>If you spotted yourself in any of the above, it’s okay &#8211; self-awareness is the first step. But if you have zero tolerance for chaos, may we suggest travelling solo, or accept that patience is a virtue. At the end of the day, no group trip is ever 100% smooth-sailing.</p>

<h3><b>What to prepare for group trips</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>So you’ve picked your destination and mentally shortlisted which friend might cause drama. But before you jet off, don’t just wing it and hope for the best.</p>

<p>Everyone knows to bring a <b>travel-sized toiletry set</b>, but in a shared bathroom, those identical bottles are just asking for confusion.</p>
<p>Avoid “whose shampoo is that <i>ah</i>?” convos by getting a set with clear labels, or just slap on your own stickers. It&#8217;s the little things that keep the peace when you’re all trying to use the sink at the same time in a tiny Airbnb toilet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>Dark Sky Reserves in Asia &amp; Australasia</b></h2>
<hr />
<p>Would you believe us if we told you that you could have a <i>sky full of stars</i> right here, earthside, without jetting off into outer space? That’s not all &#8211; you don’t even need to fly to the far Northern Hemisphere. Let’s cut to the chase: here’s where you can find the blackest, clearest skies for the ultimate stargazing experience at these <b>Dark Sky Reserves near Singapore</b>.</p>
<p>But before we get into it, one thing to note is that virtually all of these locations are pretty remote, and require a fair bit of travelling to get to &#8211; necessary, because you’ll want to be as far away from civilisation and its light pollution as possible.</p>

<hr />
<h3><b>What is a Dark Sky Reserve?</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>A Dark Sky Reserve is a designated area that protects the exceptional qualities of its night skies and nocturnal environment. The International Dark Sky Association (IDA) is behind the certification of these areas, with specific criteria that need to be met.</p>
<p>In these Dark Sky Reserves, the minimisation of light pollution is of top priority &#8211; something that’s nearly impossible in cities and developed areas. There have to be regulations that reduce artificial light, supported by the local community, with astro-tourism facilities.</p>
<p>Apart from Dark Sky Reserves, there are other kinds of designated areas under the IDA classifications: Dark Sky Communities, Dark Sky Parks, and Dark Sky Sanctuaries:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Type</b></td>
<td><b>What it is</b></td>
<td><b>Location Type</b></td>
<td><b>Best For</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Dark Sky Reserve</b></td>
<td>A large, protected area with a dark “core” and a managed surrounding “buffer” zone.</td>
<td>Usually, national parks or rural regions</td>
<td>Stargazing in scenic natural environments with some infrastructure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Dark Sky Park</b></td>
<td>A publicly or privately owned park with exceptional starry skies and a commitment to night sky conservation.</td>
<td>National/state parks, observatories, or recreation areas</td>
<td>Families, campers, amateur astronomers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Dark Sky Community</b></td>
<td>A town or city that adopts lighting ordinances and encourages public awareness to reduce light pollution.</td>
<td>Inhabited places (villages, towns)</td>
<td>Casual visitors, local residents, cultural tourism</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Dark Sky Sanctuary</b></td>
<td>The most remote and pristine dark sites in the world with the lowest levels of light pollution.</td>
<td>Isolated, often fragile ecosystems</td>
<td>Serious astrophotographers and remote adventurers</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr />
<h3><b>How many Dark Sky Reserves are there in the world?</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>At the time of writing, there are 21 Dark Sky Reserves, 19 Dark Sky Sanctuaries, 38 Dark Sky Communities, and 115 Dark Sky Parks in the world, spanning 22 countries and more than 160,000sqkm of night sky.</p>
<p>Most of these places are found in North America and Europe, but there are plenty of upcoming Dark Sky Places closer to home, right here in Asia. A little further afoot are Australia, New Zealand, and even Africa, where you’ll find designated Dark Sky Places in Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<hr />
<h3><b>Which is the largest Dark Sky Reserve in the world?</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>The single largest Dark Sky Reserve in the world is the Wood Buffalo National Park International Dark Sky Reserve at 44,907sqkm. However, you won’t find this on the IDA list, as it was minted by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC), who use a different set of criteria and processes, with a focus on Dark Sky Preserves in Canada.</p>
<p>Second to that, and the largest according to IDA’s list, is Greater Big Bend International Dark Sky Reserve, which straddles protected areas in both the USA and Mexico. It covers an area of almost 39,000sqkm, or approximately 373,300,000 soccer fields.</p>

<p>The <b>Endau-Rompin National Park</b> in the state of Johor is the largest protected area in the southern half of Peninsular Malaysia. It’s not an official Dark Sky Reserve, but you’ll find the darkest skies in this part of the world here.</p>
<p>Add to that the sights that you can look forward to by day, including <b>Upeh Guling</b>, one of Malaysia’s most gorgeous waterfalls, <b>Tasik Biru</b> with its crystal clear blue waters, and sightings of endangered Malayan tigers, tapirs, Sumatran rhinos, and Asian elephants, and you’ll have a road trip to remember.</p>
<p>Do note that it’s recommended to drive a 4WD vehicle within the park &#8211; you can park at the Johor Parks office at Bekok and use a local transport provider to head into the park. If you’re driving your own 4WD, you’ll have to register your vehicle and purchase a permit to enter the park; a <b>4WD round trip</b> between Bekok and Selai is charged at <b>RM270 (~S$82.19) </b>for 5 guests. Check out this <a href="https://hikersforlife.com/sharemyhikes/endau-rompin-selai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hikers For Life page</a> for more information on camping and other fees.</p>
<p><b>How to get there: </b>3h drive from Singapore<br />
<b>Best time to visit: </b>March-October<br />
<b>Where to stay: </b>Camp in the park (from RM3, ~S$0.91), <a href="https://rompinlodge.my/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rompin Rainforest Lodge</a> (from RM200, ~S$60/night)</p>

<p>Move over, <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/3d2n-bali-itinerary/">Bali</a>, it’s <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/lombok-things-to-do/">Lombok’s</a> time to shine. You’ll need to <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/mount-rinjani-guide/">trek up Mount Rinjani</a> for the best views, but we promise it’ll be worth it. The <b>Rinjani-Lombok Geopark </b>is a UNESCO-global geopark, on an island that sits in the infamous Ring of Fire; there’s <b>Segara Anak</b> &#8211; a crescent-shaped sulphur lake that’s also a spiritual place for the locals.</p>
<p>And perhaps most thrilling of all is Mount Rinjani and the various shorter peaks that dot the landscape &#8211; they’re active volcanoes that <i>might</i> erupt at any time. Since it’s a geopark, you’ll be guaranteed the darkest skies to be found on the Indonesian island; go on a <a href="https://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/45255-2d1n-mount-rinjani-crater-rim-trekking-lombok/?aid=27405" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-day trek</a> for a full immersion. For the less adventurous, you might consider putting yourself up at one of their many beach resorts, so you can stargaze over the Indian Ocean or Bali Sea.</p>
<p><b>How to get there: </b>Fly from Singapore to Lombok (2 hours 40 minutes)<br />
<b>Best time to visit: </b>April-October<br />

<p><b>Khao Sam Roi Yot</b>, if you ask the locals, means ‘mountain with 300 peaks’. The National Park is just south of Hua Hin, and was Thailand’s first coastal national park. One of the highlights here by day is <b>Phraya Nakhon</b>, a cave with a pavilion in it that was built in 1890. At certain times of the year, a hole in the roof of the cavern allows the sun to shine directly onto this pavilion, making for a spectacular sight.</p>
<p>Stargazing in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park is as easy as deciding on a spot to hunker down for the night. You have a wide range of locations within its borders to choose from, including open meadows, beaches and campgrounds &#8211; no mountain-climbing involved.</p>
<p><b>How to get there: </b>Fly from Singapore to Bangkok (2 hours), then a 3-hour drive to the park<br />
<b>Best time to visit: </b>November-February<br />
<b>Where to stay: </b>Camp on Laem Sala Beach or Sam Phraya Beach (from THB150, ~S$5.92/night), <a href="https://www.agoda.com/dhevan-dara-beach-villa-kui-buri/hotel/prachuap-khiri-khan-th.html?cid=1844104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dhevan Dara Beach Villa Kuiburi</a> (from S$61/night)</p>

<i>Image credit: The Asahi Shinbun</i></p>
<p>Less than an hour away from Tokyo is <b>Kozushima Island</b>, an entire island dedicated to the experience of stargazing. After sunset, this Dark Sky Island is shrouded in darkness, transforming into a planetarium the size of close to 24,000 football fields.</p>
<p>Join a local stargazing tour, and try to spot the Canopus star &#8211; the second-brightest star in the sky, which can rarely be seen from the Japanese mainland. If you visit in the colder months, keep an eye out for the Geminids meteor shower, and the Winter Triangle &#8211; an imaginary isosceles triangle formed by 3 of the brightest stars in the winter sky.</p>
<p><b>How to get there: </b>Fly from Singapore to Tokyo (7 hours), then a 45-minute flight or 4-hour high-speed jet ferry to Kozushima<br />
<b>Best time to visit: </b>September–November<br />

<i>Image credit: Explore Okayama</i></p>
<p>The easiest place to get to on this list, or the furthest away from the wilderness, is <b>Bisei Town</b> of Ibara City, Okayama. It’s an <i>actual</i> township where you’ll find the <b>Bisei Astronomical Observatory</b>, housing a 1m-wide telescope, which hosts stargazing parties every weekend. Apart from the cold winter months, some restaurants serve dinner under the stars too.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Bisei Town enacted Japan’s first light pollution prevention ordinance way back in 1989, where all outdoor lights have to be turned off after 10pm. Since then, other measures to prevent light leakage from lighting include the installation of IDA-certified light pollution prevention LED lights.</p>
<p><b>How to get there: </b>Fly from Singapore to Osaka (6.5 hours), then a 2-hour train ride to Bisei<br />

<p>North of Nagoya, in Fukui prefecture, you’ll find <b>Minami-Rokuroshi</b>, Asia’s first Urban Dark Sky Place. Beyond that, these foothills of <b>Hakusan</b> were also named the best location for star-watching in Japan by The Star Watching Network.</p>
<p>While you’re here, sign yourself up for butter- or ice cream-making workshops at a dairy farm, visit a dinosaur museum &#8211; Fukui is the dinosaur capital of Japan &#8211; hike up Hakusan, or simply disconnect and relax in an open-air onsen.</p>

<p>At 4,500m above sea level, <b>Hanle Village</b> in Ladakh, India, enjoys almost zero light and air pollution. It’s also what’s known as a rain shadow place &#8211; that is, it’s never cloudy, and virtually never rains here, making it an optimal location for stargazing.</p>
<p>This small village of 1,000 people houses a 17th-century monastery, as well as the Indian Astronomical Observatory, which is the highest of its kind in India. Be warned, however, that this is not a trip for everybody. There are only homestays here; the nearest city of Leh is 270km away, and you’ll have to acclimatise to the high altitude.</p>
<p>The running water in the village is said to start freezing over by October, so be prepared for extra harsh conditions should you want to visit in the winter months.</p>
<p><b>How to get there: </b>Fly from Singapore to Leh via Delhi (9 hours), then a 7-hour drive to Hanle<br />

<p>Australia’s longest river, Murray River, is believed by the Aboriginal Australians to be created by the tracks of the Great Ancestor as he pursued a wily Murray cod.

<p>The Maori name for <b>Stewart Island</b> is <b>Rakiura</b>, which translates to “glowing island” &#8211; thanks to the Aurora Australis which is visible from the island. Between the Southern Lights and the gazillions of stars which light up the skies of this Dark Sky Sanctuary, one might say the Maoris definitely gave Stewart Island the right name.</p>
<p>If you thought the skies at Wairarapa were dark, those here were measured at 21.93mac/arc sec2.</p>

<p>Since you’ll be going stargazing at night, you’ll want to make sure you are dressed in layers &#8211; even if you’re in the tropics. Have some extras on hand too, just in case the weather should be chillier than expected. Hand warmers, blankets, and insulated bottles of hot drinks should definitely be on your packing list if you’re going stargazing in a temperate climate.</p>
<p>On the flip side, have insect repellent on hand if you’re in the tropics, or visiting the parks in the warmer months. Depending on how long you intend to be out, other handy items to have with you include stools, ground mats, and a sleeping bag or tent if you’re staying the night.</p>
<p>If you’re not joining a photography tour, you might want to bring along a portable tripod to put your phone or camera on, in order to get the best photographs of the night sky. Don’t forget to pack along extra batteries or portable chargers too.</p>
<p>To avoid light pollution, have a red flashlight on hand; this will also not be too glaring on your eyes in the uber dark conditions in the Dark Sky areas.</p>
<p>P.S.: Do check park regulations on consuming food and drink in the park &#8211; you’re sharing the space with creatures of the wild, after all, and wouldn’t want to attract unwanted attention.</p>

<p>You’ll be surprised that most of the latest smart phones on the market are more than capable of taking amazing photos of the night sky. Of course, it’s not as easy as pointing and tapping a button; here are some steps you can take:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Turn on the Night Mode or max out the exposure.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Use a tripod.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Set a timer &#8211; better yet if you snap the photo without touching your phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the more enthusiastic smartphone astrophotographer, here’s a <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/learn/heat/resource/a-guide-to-smartphone-astrophotography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide by NASA</a> on taking photos of the night sky on your phone.</p>
<p>If you’re holding a DSLR or mirrorless camera, a fast wide-angle lens (14-28mm, f/2.8 or faster) is preferred. A lower ISO of 1600-3200, and a shutter speed of 15-25s is recommended. Follow the <b>500 rule</b>: 500 ÷ focal length = max shutter speed, and make sure you set your camera’s focus to <b>infinity</b>.</p>
<p>Shoot all your photos in RAW for greater flexibility in post-production. Where possible, try not to have your camera’s screen on, as every bit of artificial light will get in the way of shooting a great photo.</p>

<h3><b>Where to find Dark Sky Reserves near Singapore</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>As much as these Dark Sky Reserves near Singapore are naturally blessed with the perfect conditions for stargazing, it’s not 100% guaranteed that the skies will <i>always</i> be clear. Many of these spots are painful to get to, but with the spread of civilisation and its encroaching light pollution, it’s no surprise that we’ll have to go an extra mile to seek out the darkest of skies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>Riders Resort in Kulai, Johor</b></h2>
<hr />
<p>When on vacay, it’s a must to pamper ourselves with some quality<i> R&amp;R</i> time. If going horse riding round a luxe mansion fits the bill for you, you’ve got to check out<b> Riders Resort</b> on your next trip to <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/putuo-village-kulai-johor/"><b>Kulai</b></a>.</p>
<p>This colonial-style resort is also one of the fanciest accommodations around town, with amenities like an in-house restaurant, swimming pool, and stables to roam around. P.S. The horses here even have name tags with personality descriptions, so you’ll be able to befriend the friendly steeds during your visit.</p>
<hr />
<h3><b>How to get to Riders Resort in Kulai?</b></h3>
<hr />
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362610" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kulai-sign.png" alt="kulai sign" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kulai-sign.png 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kulai-sign-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kulai-sign-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kulai-sign-768x512.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Riders Resort is located within The Legends Golf &amp; Country Resort, a golf club in Kulai. It’s a little further out from the town centre, so we’d recommend either driving there straight from JBCC &#8211; which would take around an hour &#8211; or booking a 22-minute cab ride from Kulai’s KTM station.</p>

<p>While you don’t have to be a resort guest to take part in Riders Resort’s activities, those wanting the full experience can book a stay in one of the <b>25 rooms</b> available.</p>
<p><i><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362619" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-small-room.png" alt="Riders Resort - small room" width="1300" height="700" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-small-room.png 1300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-small-room-300x162.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-small-room-1024x551.png 1024w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-small-room-150x81.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-small-room-768x414.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /><br />
Verandah Twin Room.<br />
</i><i>Image credit: Riders Resort</i></p>
<p>As you might expect, all the rooms here have that cosy, country club feel, with homey wooden furniture and windows looking out to pretty nature views. They start at <b>RM328 (~S$100.24)/night</b> for a <b>Verandah Twin Room </b>for up to <b>3 pax</b>, and go up to <b>RM867 (~S$264.95)/night</b> for a <b>Manor Suite for 4</b>.</p>
<p><i><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362606" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/big-room-2.png" alt="big room 2" width="1300" height="700" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/big-room-2.png 1300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/big-room-2-300x162.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/big-room-2-1024x551.png 1024w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/big-room-2-150x81.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/big-room-2-768x414.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /><br />
Manor Suite.<br />
</i><i>Image credit: Riders Resort</i></p>
<p>Both rooms come with breakfast for 2 and 4 pax respectively, but the key difference between them lies in their size and amenities. While the twin room has a simple bedroom with a small study that’s ideal for couples, the Manor Suite is perfect for a group of friends, equipped with a living area, grand balcony, and even a rattan daybed.</p>

<p>Now, on to the fun part. Whether or not you’re planning to stay the night, Riders Resort is a must-visit place for horse lovers. Here, you’ll be able to go horse riding regardless of your experience level, or simply pet and feed the horses in their stables.</p>

<h3><b>Go horse riding from $48/pax at Riders Resort</b></h3>
<hr />
<p><i><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362617" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-horse-riding.png" alt="Riders Resort - horse riding" width="1300" height="700" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-horse-riding.png 1300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-horse-riding-300x162.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-horse-riding-1024x551.png 1024w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-horse-riding-150x81.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-horse-riding-768x414.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /><br />
Image credit: Riders Resort</i></p>
<p>Guided horse rides start at<b> RM160 (~S$48.90)/pax </b>for a <b>30-minute trail</b>, but those who’re serious about honing their equestrian skills can opt for private lessons starting at <b>RM238 (~S$72.73)/pax</b> for a <b>30 minute sesh</b>. We’d recommend bringing your pals along though, ’cos group lessons cost less, at just <b>RM242 (~S$73.95)/pax</b> for a <b>1-hour lesson</b>.</p>
<p><i>BTW</i>, you won’t have to worry about having prior riding experience. When booking your session, you’ll get to indicate whether you’re a beginner, novice, or intermediate rider, and be matched to a suitable instructor and horse. Little ones 8 years old and above are free to join in on the fun too!</p>
<p>Do note that lessons have to be booked at least 3 days in advance via their <a href="https://www.ridersresort.com.my/product/horse-riding/">website</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><b>Meet &amp; feed horses from S$1.50</b></h3>
<hr />

<p>If horse riding isn’t really your thing, or you’ve got kiddos who’re a tad too young to attempt the sport, you can still get up close and personal with the fab steeds during horse-feeding sessions.</p>
<p>All you’ll have to do is purchase carrots from the staff for just <b>RM5 (~S$1.53)/packet</b>, and you’ll have enough snacks to feed all 14 of the adorable horses in the stable.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362609" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/horse-feeding-2.jpg" alt="horse feeding 2" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/horse-feeding-2.jpg 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/horse-feeding-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/horse-feeding-2-150x100.jpg 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/horse-feeding-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Our favourite part of this experience was definitely getting to know each horse on a first-name basis.</p>
<p><i><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362613" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-by-appointment.jpg" alt="Riders Resort - by appointment" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-by-appointment.jpg 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-by-appointment-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-by-appointment-150x100.jpg 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Riders-Resort-by-appointment-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
Thankfully, we didn’t actually have to make an appointment to meet the shy steed. </i></p>
<p>Yep, the horses here have some of the quirkiest names we’ve seen, like Lord Lester &#8211; a name fitting for this regal lad &#8211; and By Appointment, the self-proclaimed “resident introvert” who, we guess, will only meet deserving guests <i>“by appointment”</i>.</p>

There are ponies here too!</i></p>
<p><i>BTW</i>, we’re told that the horses respond better to their names being called, so that’s a little pro-tip for those of you who want to earn favour with the cute animals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>How </b><b>to buy</b><b> TOTO &amp; 4D </b><b>in</b><b> Singapore</b></h2>
<hr />
<p>We’ve seen the queues snaking all around the block – yes, <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/tags/singapore-pools/">Singapore Pools</a> outlets often boast crowds far beyond the most popular of F&amp;B stalls.</p>
<p>But when it comes to buying TOTO and 4D, while the older generations are the <i>lao jiaos</i>, most of us are clueless about the ins and outs of the system beyond Quick Pick.  So here’s <b>how to buy TOTO and 4D in Singapore</b>, to help you <i>actually</i> understand what you’re doing the next time you place a bet:</p>
<p><i>P.S. Before you dive straight in, </i><i>here’s </i><i>a gentle reminder to bet within your means and gamble responsibly!</i></p>

<p>Here’s a quick run-through of the different terms to know how to properly play TOTO in Singapore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group TOTO = split the bet with several people</li>
<li>QP = Quick Pick (randomly-generated numbers)</li>
<li>Void = cancel submission</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of TOTO, in short, is to correctly guess the 6 winning numbers that will appear in the draw. The more winning numbers you nail, the more you’ll win. Below are the <b>differen</b><b>t types</b><b> of ways </b><b>to place your </b><b>TOTO bet</b>:</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>1. Ordinary Entry</b></h4>
<hr />
<p>The most common and straightforward TOTO bet type is the <b>Ordinary Entry</b>. Think of it as the basic setting in a game – it’s great for beginners, but there are no extra features you can use to increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Steps to placing an Ordinary Entry bet (each bet costs $1):</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shade the 6 numbers you wish to bet on, from 1 to 49. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Leave the Sys 7 &#8211; Sys Roll options blank.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">TOTO draws take place twice a week. Shade Draw 2 to play your bet for the upcoming draw and the following one. Draw 4 will enter your bet in the next 4 draws. Leave these boxes blank if you only want to play for the upcoming round. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Get your ticket and keep it safe &#8211; you’ll need it to collect your prize if you win.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alternatively, if you’re looking for an even simpler way to place your bet, head to the counter and opt for</span><b> Quick Pick (QP)</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, where you’ll get a computer-generated set of random numbers, also priced at $1 per bet.</span></p>
<hr />
<h4><b>2. System Entry</b></h4>
<hr />
<p>There are also other “Systems” you can choose, which, if we are to continue with the game analogy, you can think of as advanced settings. They cost more, but also statistically increase the probability of you winning by giving you extra “power-ups”. To indicate that you’re playing these systems, shade the system of your choice on the left side of the TOTO slip accordingly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With </span><b>System Entry</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, pick extra numbers to increase your chances of hitting the winning ones. Instead of being limited to the usual 6, choose from 7 to 12 numbers. Take note that prices increase accordingly and can range from $7 all the way to $924. </span></p>
<hr />
<h4><b>3. System Roll</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For </span><b>System Roll</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, you’ll pick 5 numbers out of the 6. The extra feature you’ll get here is a Rolling Number (R). This R represents any of the remaining 44 numbers, pretty much like the blank tile in Scrabble. Since you’ll be essentially placing 44 different bets, prices start from $44.</span></p>
<hr />
<h4><b>4. TOTO Match</b></h4>

<p>If you’ve made it this far, we’re guessing you’re still getting the hang of TOTO. But here’s something new: <a href="https://mustsharenews.com/toto-match/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Singapore Pools recently announced the launch of <b>TOTO Match</b></a>, a fresh way of playing.</p>
<p>Opposed to how you normally play TOTO, there’s no jackpot involved here. TOTO Match dishes out fixed prizes based on the type of bet you place. In other words, the more you bet, the more you stand to win.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to place your bets:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Match Additional Number (M AN):</b> pick a number from 1 to 49 &#8211; if it happens to match the additional number from the draw, you’ll win $30 for every $1 bet.</li>
<li><b>Match 2 (M 2): </b>pick 2 numbers between 1 and 49 &#8211; if both your numbers match any 2 of the 6 winning numbers from the draw, you’ll bag $50 for every $1 bet.</li>
<li><b>Match 3 (M 3):</b> pick 3 numbers between 1 and 49 &#8211; match all 3 with any of the 6 winning numbers and you’ll walk away with $500 for every $1 bet.</li>
<li><b>Match 4 (M 4): </b>pick 4 numbers between 1 and 49 &#8211; if all 4 match the 6 winning numbers, you’ll score $7,000 for every $1 bet.</li>
</ul>
<div class="video-container">							<lite-youtube videoid="qeH8XGC5mCI" playlabel="How to Play: TOTO MATCH"></lite-youtube>
			</div>
<p>Take note that for M 2, M 3, and M 4, the additional number from each draw doesn’t count. That means your picks have to match the main 6 winning numbers only.</p>
<p>You can start trying your luck with TOTO Match from <b>10th June 2025 </b>at any Singapore Pools retail outlet. It’s not available online for now, so you’ll have to go old-school and head down in person. Make sure you’re placing a TOTO Match bet specifically &#8211; regular TOTO bets won’t get you in on the action.</p>

<p>The one you’ll need to pay most attention to is <b>Group 1</b>, AKA the <i>ultimate</i> jackpot prize, guaranteed to be $1 million or more, depending on how much money is in the prize pool. If there’s more than 1 winner, the prize money will be split equally within the group – the same applies to Groups 2 to 4.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a Group 5 to 7 win, don’t worry, there’s no need to share that loot – your winning prizes in those categories are fixed!</p>
<p>To spice things up for players, there is also a bonus 7th number that’s drawn, called the Additional Number. Getting this number right will unlock extra prize money, as long as you get at least 3 out of the 6 Winning Numbers correct.</p>
<p>There are plenty of chances to place your bets, with 2 draws held weekly on <b>Mondays</b> and <b>Thursdays </b>at <b>6.30pm</b>. If it is a cascade draw, then it’ll take place at <b>9.30pm</b>. Make sure to place your bets before submission closes at <b>6pm</b> on the day of the draw. TOTO results will be posted on their <a href="https://online.singaporepools.com/en/lottery">website</a> and also displayed at Singapore Pools outlets.</p>

<p>In a game of 4D, players bet on a number between 0 and 9999, and in each round, up to 23 numbers will be drawn. Below are the <b>different </b><b>4D bet types </b><b>and </b><b>how to play </b><b>them in</b><b> Singapore</b>:</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>1. Ordinary</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><b>Ordinary</b> bets are the most common way to play, and each bet costs $1. To bet, you’ll need to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pick a number between 0000 to 9999 and shade it on the slip.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Select your draw days from 3 options &#8211; Wed, Sat or Sun.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Leave the “iBet” and “SYS Entry” boxes blank</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Choose between placing a Big bet (大) or a Small bet (小). The Small Bet has a higher risk and higher reward &#8211; read more about this under “How the draw works”.</span></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h4><b>2. System Entry</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing about 4D is, unlike TOTO, the sequence of numbers matters &#8211; meaning if you’ve entered 1234 and the draw is 4321 instead, it doesn’t count. To cover all grounds, pick </span><b>System Entry</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to enter all the possible permutations of the numbers you’ve picked. Prices will vary depending on the number of permutations.</span></p>
<hr />
<h4><b>3. iBet</b></h4>
<hr />
<p>System Entry can get pricey, and if you’d like your $1 to stretch across all the possible permutations, you can pick<b> iBet</b> as your 4D bet type instead. It is essentially the same as System Entry, except you pay just the standard $1. The downside? If you’ve guessed the right number, the payout is lower as well.</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>4. 4D Roll</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last type of entry you can play is </span><b>4D Roll</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, where you pick 3 numbers instead of 4 and mark R in the place of the remaining number. R represents any number from 0 to 9 and works much like TOTO’s System Roll. This will cost you 10 times your bet amount.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3><b>Betting with Singapore Pools</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>Having a go at the lottery can be done in the name of fun, but always remember that the chances of striking it big with 4D or TOTO are slim, <i>very </i>slim. To put things into perspective, the chances of hitting the jackpot in TOTO are 1 in 14 million, which is less probable than getting struck by lightning, hit by a meteorite or going down in a plane crash.</p>
<p>So, always remember to gamble responsibly and know when to stop!</p>

<p>They say every garden needs a water feature, and lucky for us, Singapore has fountains aplenty, complementing our green belt zones and nature gardens. We’ve compiled a list of <b>fountains in Singapore</b> &#8211; some are picturesque, some are historical, but all are pretty iconic. Try and see how many you recognise.</p>

<h3><b>1. Fountain of Wealth</b></h3>

<h4><b>Largest fountain in the world</b></h4>

<p>You can’t talk about fountains in Singapore without mentioning the <b>Fountain of Wealth</b>, which holds the title of the largest fountain in the world. Situated in the heart of <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/tags/suntec-city/">Suntec City</a>, this massive bronze ring’s name and design were derived from Chinese <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/tags/feng-shui/"><i>feng shui</i></a>, with water flowing inward that symbolises wealth and life pouring in. Its design draws inspiration from the Hindu Mandala, meant to represent unification, equality, and harmony.</p>
<p>At select periods of the day, the fountain is turned off and visitors can enter to walk around the mini-fountain at the centre of the base. If you’re still hanging around after sunset, be sure to catch the <b>daily light and laser performance</b> from <b>8pm</b> <b>to</b> <b>9.30pm</b>.</p>

<p>Perhaps our most iconic water feature, the <b>Jewel Rain Vortex</b> is the world’s tallest indoor waterfall, with water cascading down 7 storeys of our <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/jewel-changi/">Jewel Changi Airport</a>. The glass roof is toroid-shaped, with a sloped oculus at the mouth of the fountain, creating the illusion of a building continuously turning into liquid.</p>
<p>Standing at 40m high, recirculated rainwater is pumped to the roof before free-falling all the way down to a pool in the basement. The <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/tags/changi-airport/">Changi Airport</a> Skytrain, connecting the airport terminals, allows travellers to get a bird’s-eye view of the Rain Vortex as it passes right by.</p>
<p><b>Pro tip:</b> if you plan to head down for a visit, go in the evening for the<b> light and music show</b>, where the fountain transforms into a spectacularly colourful display. Catch it at <b>8pm</b> and <b>9pm</b> from <b>Monday to Thursday</b>, and <b>8pm</b>, <b>9pm</b>, and <b>10pm</b> from <b>Friday to Sunday</b>, including the <b>eve and actual day of </b><a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/tags/public-holiday-singapore/"><b>public holidays</b></a>.</p>

<p>Erected in 1882 at Fullerton Square, <b>Tan Kim Seng Fountain</b> was named in honour of philanthropist Tan Kim Seng for his donations towards Singapore&#8217;s first reservoir and waterworks. It has since been relocated to the <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/esplanade-theatres-on-the-bay/">Esplanade</a>, where it stands today, and was gazetted as a national monument in 2010.</p>
<p>Made from cast iron, this Victorian-style water fountain stands at 7m high with classical figures adorning its 3 tiers. The fountain features 4 Muses of Greece &#8211; Calliope, the Muse of epic poetry; Clio, the Muse of history; Erato, the Muse of lyric poetry; and Melpomene, the Muse of tragedy. Beneath them, the 4 faces of Poseidon, god of the sea, spout water into the basin below.</p>

<p>If you haven’t taken a picture with your mouth open pretending to drink from the <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/merlion-park-singapore/">Merlion</a>, you haven’t truly been to and lived in Singapore. As the official mascot of Singapore, this mythical creature is a national symbol and has been spouting water ever since it was sculpted in 1972.</p>
<p>Standing at 8.6m high, it was originally located along the Singapore River before being moved to the <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/tags/cbd/">CBD</a> area in 2002. While the former <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/sentosa-singapore/">Sentosa</a> Merlion has since been demolished (RIP), 6 official Merlions remain in Singapore &#8211; but this one remains the OG. It even survived a lightning strike back in 2009, proving it’s not just a national icon, but a tough one at that.</p>

<p>Make no mistake &#8211; <b>Gemmill Fountain</b> is no ordinary water fountain. Its design is definitely unique compared to your average water cooler, with a lion head mounted at the centre and structurally made from marble.</p>
<p>It was the first public drinking fountain located in Raffles Place, donated by John Gemmill back in 1864, the first auctioneer of Singapore and the guy it’s named after. It currently stands on the outdoor terrace of the <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/national-museum-of-singapore/">National Museum of Singapore</a> and allegedly still functions as a drinking fountain. We wouldn’t recommend putting that to the test, though.</p>

<p>The <b>Rain Oculus</b> at <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/shoppes-at-marina-bay-sands/">Marina Bay Sands</a> is an eco-friendly artwork installation that serves double duty as a skylight and rain collector. Completed in 2011, the fountain collects rainwater and funnels it into an enormous acrylic bowl before releasing it into the pool below, utilising architecture in its innovative water display.</p>
<p>The pumps that deliver the water to the bowl are constantly turned on and off, so the whirlpool and flow of water are continuously shifting in shape and intensity. You can observe the water from different vantage points, even getting up close and personal in a <i>sampan</i> boat along the mall’s canal.</p>

<p>The <b>Raffles Hotel Fountain</b> can be found in the hotel’s Palm Garden and stands as the iconic centrepiece of the courtyard. Dyed an ornate blue, it’s the perfect IG-worthy spot to capture those overseas luxury holiday vibes.</p>
<p>Standing tall at 6m, the antique cast iron fountain was originally crafted in Glasgow and then brought over to Singapore in the 1890s, where it was situated at Lau Pa Sat. After relocating a couple more times, it was finally donated to Raffles Hotel in 1990. Plus, passers-by can still access it to take a picture even if they aren’t a hotel guest.</p>

<p>Shopping in <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/tags/orchard-road/">Orchard Road</a> comes hand in hand with tired feet from all that walking. Thankfully, there’s the <b>Takashimaya Basement Fountain</b>, the best spot for a seat after a long day of shopping. It’s an all-too-familiar experience, sitting beside the playful jets of water while your parents continue to shop before heading home.</p>
<p>It’s also perfect as a waiting area for when you’re meeting friends in Orchard and they’re running a bit late. Good luck getting a seat, though &#8211; we’ve literally never been by and seen an empty seat.</p>

<p>The <b>Clarke Quay Central Fountain</b> is a familiar sight for clubbers and anyone who enjoys the <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/unique-nightlife-singapore/">nightlife</a> in the area. It’s right in the middle of the <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/clarke-quay-things-to-do/">Clarke Quay</a> intersection, between various eateries, <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/tags/clubs-in-singapore/">nightclubs</a>, and <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/tags/bars-in-singapore/">bars</a>.</p>
<p>When the sun sets, the fountain comes alive with an array of eye-catching lights and is the focal point of the riverside village. If you’ve ever run through a fountain like this as a child, you could totally relive your memories and challenge yourself to charge through without getting wet &#8211; although you might want to be sober for that.</p>

<p>The <b>Whampoa Dragon Fountain Statue</b> was built in 1973 &#8211; it might no longer spout water, but it’s still very much a local icon. Find it in front of Block 85 of Whampoa Drive, opposite the CTE. Standing at 4.8m tall, the dragon’s body is made from broken china rice bowls, which were individually stuck on.</p>
<p>The statue’s surrounding basin area was later refurbished with grass and topiary designs. Today, the statue still stands proudly as a neighbourhood mascot, with residents congregating nearby to chat or hang out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>Nature-themed cafes near JB checkpoint</b></h2>
<hr />
<p>In today’s lesson of <i>every day we learn something new</i>, we find out that an anthophile is a person who loves flowers and plants. If that sounds like you, you’re going to want to add these nature-themed cafes near JB checkpoint to your list of <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/jb-cafe-guide/">cafes in JB</a> to check out.</p>
<p>Most of these cafes are hard to miss given that their exteriors are covered in greenery from head-to-toe. And the best part is that you won’t have to go too far after getting past customs – they’re all under an hour from the Malaysian borders, with many of them only a 10-20 minute drive away. IG-worthy cafes, here we come.</p>

<hr />
<h3><b>1. The Secret Forest</b></h3>
<hr />
<h4><b>Glassy, campsite-themed cafe</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362243" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-exterior.png" alt="The Secret Forest exterior" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-exterior.png 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-exterior-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-exterior-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-exterior-768x512.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Level up your alfresco cafe experience with a visit to <b>The Secret Forest</b>. Located just a 5-minute drive from The Mall, <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/midvalley-southkey-jb/">Midvalley Southkey</a>, you’ll find several shipping containers fashioned into a curious-looking cafe nestled on a plot of gravel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362245" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-interior.png" alt="The Secret Forest interior" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-interior.png 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-interior-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-interior-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-interior-768x512.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Of course, you’re recommended to lounge on the camping chairs to enjoy your meals in the great outdoors for maximum vibes. The cafe also hosts live band performances every week, from Thursdays to Sundays; the best views of the shows are right outside too. But if the sun’s overbearing, you can head on inside to sip on your drinks in the comfort of air-conditioning.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362244" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-food.png" alt="The Secret Forest food" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-food.png 1000w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-food-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-food-150x100.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Secret-Forest-food-768x512.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Speaking of which, you’ll find your usual cafe fare right here. Their <b>Smoked Duck Aglio Olio (RM18.90, ~S$5.78)</b> is just the thing for those looking for something more substantial, and for dessert, go for a sweet slice of <b>Chocolate Burnt Cheesecake (RM15.90, ~S$4.86)</b>. Afterwards, wash everything down with a cup of either <b>Caramel Latte (RM17, ~S$5.20)</b> or <b>Matcha Strawberry Milk (RM16, ~S$4.89)</b>.</p>

<p>Already pretty popular amongst Singaporeans, <a href="https://thesmartlocal.my/soil-cafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Soil</b></a> is just 30 minutes from the JB checkpoint. Resembling a cottage in the countryside, the cafe has plenty of aesthetic spots for you to take #OOTD pics from various angles.</p>
<p>It’s located within <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/eco-spring-labs-johor-bahru/">Eco Spring Labs</a> too, which means you can conveniently hop to other eateries within the vicinity. Fair warning – they only accept walk-ins and it gets pretty crowded on the weekends, so be prepared to wait for a table.</p>

<p>You may have seen this one making the rounds on socials; <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/rainforest-tree-house-kulai/"><b>Rainforest Tree House</b></a> is a 3-storey cafe in <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/gunung-pulai-johor/">Gunung Pulai Recreational Forest</a>. The cafe is <i>ulu</i> enough to make you forget about the city and reconnect with nature, but don’t worry, it’s only 40 minutes away from Malaysian customs – trust us, the drive will be worth it.</p>
<p>The highlight of this cafe is the suspended net beds on each floor with views of the surrounding greenery. Nibble on freshly baked <b>Wood Fire Bread with Signature Dips (RM19, ~S$5.81)</b> or choose a hearty main like the <b>Prawn Aglio Olio (RM28, ~S$8.56)</b> and dine with the sounds of the rainforest.</p>

<p>If you’re there on a Friday or Saturday for the dinner timeslot, go early and grab the best seats in the house to catch the sunset from the second floor. There’s also the option to stay overnight in the treehouse hotel if you can’t get enough.</p>

<p>There’s no need to fly all the way to Kyoto to see a bamboo forest, just cross the border and head to <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/putuo-village-kulai-johor/">Putuo Village</a> in JB. This Buddhist sanctuary houses a temple, a giant wishing tree, and the <a href="https://mustsharenews.com/fat-bamboo-cafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Fat Bamboo Cafe</b></a>.</p>

<p>Located 45 minutes from the checkpoint, the cafe is most known for its <b>signature ice cream (RM10, </b><b>~S$3.06</b><b>)</b> served in a bamboo culm. You know you want these IG-worthy soft serves so here are the best-selling flavours: Bamboo Charcoal Chocolate and Japanese Classic Matcha.</p>

<p>Apart from munching on brunch staples like their <b>Big Brother Benedict (RM46, ~S$14.06)</b>, it’s also open all day until late, so you can head there too for afternoon tea, or an evening tipple and dinner. <b>Cocktails</b> start at just <b>RM35 (</b><b>~S$10.70</b><b>)</b> and the fairy lights around the garden area turn on after dark for that added fairy tale effect.</p>

<p>Once inside the glass dome, you’ll find one of the most photogenic interiors ever, with plants hanging from the ceiling and natural sunlight pouring in. It can get pretty hot in the afternoon so we suggest going in the evening when you might even catch a glimpse of the sunset.</p>

<p>Even the desserts and drinks here are adorned with edible flowers or have flower-themed designs. The much-raved signature <b>Plantherapy Special Brie Cheese Cake (RM25.90, </b><b>~S$7.92</b><b>)</b>, paired with their <b>Shades of Brown iced latte (RM16.90, </b><b>~S$5.17</b><b>)</b> are must-tries. Needless to say, it’s a great spot for celebrating special occasions too.</p>

<p>Good news for those with cats and doggos – the cafe is pet friendly too. There’s a huge garden out front where they can run around without disturbing any diners. Should they get peckish too, the cafe’s got Puppy<b> Meal bowls (RM15, ~S$4.59)</b> for them, which consists of bacon, fresh broccoli and carrots, a sweet potato treat, and a chicken onigiri.</p>

<p>We were pleasantly surprised to find a <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/singapore-inspired-places/">“Little Singapore”</a> in JB with a replica of the Dakota neighbourhood. So, imagine our delight when we found out that there’s also a “Little Paris” in JB at Mount Austin that’s just 25 minutes away from customs.</p>
<p><b>Cafe de Flore</b> brings its diners to Europe with its Parisian-inspired decor. The cafe is modelled after an actual French cafe of the same name, but hold on – they serve authentic Thai food here. The surprises just don’t stop.</p>

<p>Both outdoor and indoor seating are available. If you prefer going al fresco, request a seat in the garden where European-looking statues will keep you company.  If the weather is too hot, head indoors where you’ll see black and white tiled flooring and a lot of plants.</p>
<p>On the menu are classic Thai dishes, including Pad Thai, Tom Yum Soup, and Green Curry.</p>

<p>Singaporeans roaming around <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/paradigm-mall-jb/">Paradigm Mall JB</a>, we see you catching a movie at the cinema for just ~S$4. Once you’ve had enough of being indoors and need a breath of fresh air, drive 10 minutes down to <b>Lune24</b> where you’ll get to dine in an outdoor garden.</p>

<p>Picture wooden tables, including some low ones paired with comfy sofas, and being surrounded by fairy lights. It’s quite a romantic atmosphere here after sundown. And if you’re worried about sweating through your date, you’ll be happy to know that there are a number of giant fans near the seating area to keep the temperature cool.</p>
<p>Couples looking for a little more privacy can request seats in the few nooks and corners of the cafe. Occasionally, the cafe hosts live performances and art markets too. Just check their socials to find out when such events take place.</p>

<p>One spot that’s slowly gaining traction among serial cafe hoppers is <b>Grind</b>. Don’t be fooled by its unassuming storefront; step right in and you’ll understand why the coffee-loving crowd are drawn to its aesthetic interior. The cafe takes on a rustic, industrial theme, leaving beams and pillars raw and unfinished as the plants inside give the premises a pop of green.</p>

<p>Although visitors have noted the cafe to be a little dim at times, visit during the day or better yet, sunset, to catch golden hour as the sun rays creep in via the skylight overhead. The cafe also sells merch like <b>oversized tees</b>, in case your wardrobe needs new threads.</p>

<p>Food-wise, you won’t find full-on mains here, but their offerings are nothing to be scoffed at either. If you’re looking for recommendations, their Smoked Salmon Bagel (RM20, ~S$6.11) is a consistent best-seller, and their Espresso Tonic (RM13, ~S$3.97) is definitely one that packs a punch when you need a pick-me-up.</p>

<p>If you’re willing to venture a little further out of JB into <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/kluang-johor-malaysia/">Kluang</a>, <a href="https://thesmartlocal.my/hill-and-heal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Hill &amp; Heal</b></a> is another nature-themed cafe worth a visit. It’ll take roughly an hour and a half to reach the cafe which lies at the foothills of Gunung Lambak and is only open on the weekends from Friday to Sunday.</p>
<p>There are camping-style seats in the glasshouse for those who want to dine indoors. But the outdoor area is definitely more popular as one can admire the surrounding natural beauty while sipping on a latte. If you really want to make the most out of your visit, try the hike to the summit of the mountain – a trail that takes around 4-5 hours in total.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>Pilates studios in Singapore</b></h2>
<hr />
<p>You’ve seen it on TikTok and Instagram; even K-pop idols say that this is <i>the</i> workout to get on. That’s right, we’re talking about pilates. Originally employed by professional dancers in the early 20th century to prevent injuries and enhance flexibility, this exercise has evolved into a comprehensive, full-body, and low-impact workout accessible to everyone.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--tw-prose-body); font-size: 1rem;">Pilates works various muscle groups to build control over your body&#8217;s movements, and is a great way to get that spicy beach bod. From “hot” pilates classes to affordable packages, we’ve rounded up several <b>pilates studios</b> <b>in Singapore</b> to check out. Time to breathe in, breathe out, and scroll on.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--tw-prose-body); font-size: 1rem;"></span></p>
<hr />
<h3><b>What do I need for a pilates class?</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>Form-fitting exercise clothes are ideal for pilates classes so that your instructor will be able to see your posture and correct your form as needed. Men can opt for <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZRJc3B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gym shorts</a> and a more <a href="https://amzn.to/4gomohD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">form-fitting t-shirt</a>, while women ideally should wear a <a href="https://amzn.to/3DpMan4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longline sports bra</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/4iK4mrw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pilates leggings</a>. <a href="https://amzn.to/4iJvsPI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grip socks</a> are a must to prevent slipping on the mat, reformer, or any other pilates equipment.</p>
<hr />
<h3><b>Types of pilates classes </b><b>in Singapore</b></h3>
<hr />
<h4><b>Mat pilates</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><i><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-349843" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pilates-studio-Mat.png" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pilates-studio-Mat.png 600w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pilates-studio-Mat-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pilates-studio-Mat-150x100.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></i><br />
<i>Image credit: Shutterstock</i></p>
<p><b>Mat pilates</b> entails a sequence of exercises executed on the floor, utilising gravity and your body weight for resistance. The main objective is to strengthen your deeper, stabilising muscles to enhance posture, balance, and coordination.</p>
<p>It offers an accessible and beginner-friendly foundation to help you understand the basics of pilates, before eventually moving onto pilates workouts which involve equipment.</p>
<hr />
<h4><b>Reformer pilates</b></h4>
<hr />
<p><i><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-349844" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pilates-studio-Reformer.png" alt="" width="626" height="417" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pilates-studio-Reformer.png 626w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pilates-studio-Reformer-300x200.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pilates-studio-Reformer-150x100.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></i><br />
<i>Image credit: Freepik</i></p>
<p><b>Reformer pilates</b> makes use of a reformer machine, which is operated through the resistance of springs and pulleys that are used to push and pull the sliding carriage. It is a low-impact workout that targets isolated muscle groups.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, reformer pilates is not necessarily harder than mat pilates. The main difference is that mat pilates relies more on body weight and groundwork, while the level of resistance you get using the reformer can be easily adjusted with its springs and pulleys.</p>
<p>For those with injuries or have a limited level of mobility, the reformer method can serve as a safer alternative and provide more assistance as you do the exercises.</p>
<hr />

<p><b>Chair pilates</b> uses a contraption called, well, the pilates chair. It is a contraption fitted with springs, pedals, and handles so you can get a full-body workout that also works your balance, coordination, and flexibility.</p>
<p>Fun fact: chair pilates workouts are so effective at improving your arm and leg strength that it is a popular training method for athletes partaking in the likes of soccer, rugby, track, and hockey.</p>

<p>Don’t be intimidated by this complex machine that resembles a massage bed mixed with acrobatic fixtures. A pilates Cadillac is essentially a raised platform fitted with an overhead trapeze. The trapeze is able to hold attachments like various bars, handles, and springs such that you can accomplish different pilates moves and target a range of muscle groups.</p>
<p>Cadillac pilates classes are usually an option reserved for private classes. It’s definitely a level-up to consider if you’ve already conquered other forms of pilates. For those who have mobility difficulties, the elevated platform in Cadillac pilates also makes it gentler on the joints to get on and off of, as compared to mat pilates which involves lowering oneself onto the floor.</p>

<p><b>Tirisula RX Pilates</b> is Singapore’s first self-access Reformer Pilates studio offering pilates girlies and guys a new way to work out with more flexibility. Using smart tech, you can reserve your spot through the Tirisula app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/kh/app/tirisula/id6744297075">App Store</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ribbon.tirisula&amp;hl=en_SG">Google Play</a>), show up 15 minutes before class, and just unlock the studio with Bluetooth.</p>
<p>No front desk, no instructor, and zero stress about booking a spot for your favourite class. Each 50-minute guided class plays one of over 6,000 pre-recorded videos, with different difficulty levels and new workouts every week. It’s like using a Reformer at the gym while following a video at your own convenience and time. In fact, classes start as early as 6.30am for early risers looking to squeeze in a workout before going about the rest of their day.</p>

<p>The studio uses custom 2.1m-long Split Reformers, ideal for taller users, with 12 high-quality springs that offer more variety in movements like practising splits. Machines are maintained by in-house mechanics too, and worn parts are swapped out regularly to ensure the equipment is safe.</p>
<p>For those who want a bit more guidance, an RX+ class offers the same self-led format, but with an assistant instructor who can help adjust springs and check your form. Psst… we heard that in the future, you can expect individual screens for each Reformer and maybe even a hologram of trainer Master Ram.</p>
<p><b>Trial packages</b> cost <b>$70</b>, which gives you 70 credits to use within a month, and each class is 15 credits. If you get <strong>Ultimate Pack ($3,000 for 4,000 credits)</strong>, you can bring the cost of each session down to <strong>$11.28</strong>!</p>
<p><b>Types of pilates available: </b>Reformer</p>
<p><b>Tirisula RX Pilates review: &#8220;</b>I&#8217;ve been to their other branches (at Paya Lebar and Lavender) and was so excited to hear that they&#8217;re having a new one at Kovan!! And this branch stands out because you&#8217;re able to book on the fly and work out on your own (with a screen guide!) A clean place and possibly the future of Pilates in Singapore. Rooting for greater heights achieved, Tirisula!&#8221;<br />

<p>Think of <b>Lab Studios</b> as an all-in-one establishment. They offer barre, yoga, mat and reformer pilates, and even classes centred around stretching and prenatal exercises. Plus, they have 7 locations all around Singapore which makes it super accessible.</p>
<p>Pilates wise, they have a <b>Mat Pilates Trial Pack</b> where first-timers can get 5<b> sessions for $125</b>. Otherwise, you can drop in for a <b>Reformers Pilates class at $42/session</b>, or purchase packages <b>from $350 for 10 sessions</b>.</p>
<p><b>Types of pilates available: </b>Mat, reformer</p>
<p><b>Lab Studios review:</b> “Great classes and instructors. The facilities are well-designed, but the floor pops up in some areas which may cause accidents. The studio could also benefit from some TLC, as there is visible grime and dead plants.”<br />

<p><b>Absolute Pilates </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">might be a familiar name to many. That’s because they have 6 locations around Singapore, and they even offer </span><a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/spin-classes-singapore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spin classes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> too. </span></p>
<p>A drop-in class credit costs <b>$59</b>, and you can use it for both spin and pilates sessions across all studio locations. To get a taste of their pilates sessions in particular, you can get a <b>$44</b><b> trial package</b> for <strong>2</strong><b> pilates classes</b> across all their studios. We’ll do the maths for you – that’s just $22 per class.</p>
<p><b>Types of pilates available:</b> Reformer, chair</p>
<p><b>Absolute Pilates review:</b> “I’ve attended the pilates classes here for a year and it can get challenging, but I love a challenge. The beginner classes are good for newbies to pick up the essentials. Classes here run on a fast flow so you need to listen carefully and observe, if not others suffer while holding their positions.”<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gyrotonic and Gyrokinesis &#8211; 2 words that probably sound foreign to most of us. TL;DR, these are methods used to help injured individuals to promote an increased range of motion and stronger joint stability. And even if you’re whole and intact &#8211; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">congrats</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; you can still try pilates that combines these methods at </span><b>idō Studio</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Group classes are priced <b>$50/session</b> for <b>mat pilates</b> and <b>$70/session</b> for <b>equipment pilates</b>. Meanwhile, <b>1-to-1</b> classes go for <b>$165/session</b>.</p>
<p><b>Types of pilates available:</b> Mat, specialised equipment (Gyrotonic Pulley Tower)</p>
<p><b>idō Studio review:</b> “It is a lovely studio with skillful and passionate trainers. I started last month and have been attending sessions weekly. Each session helps me to recalibrate my body, release tension, and increase my body’s awareness which improves my posture overall.”<br />

<p><b>Strong Pilates</b> has a dedicated Beginner Class which serves as an introduction to the reformer equipment, laying down the foundational techniques for newbies. From there, you can opt for a Pilates-Only class, Strong Sweat for high-intensity to torch more calories, Strong Body to get a full-body workout, or Strong Loaded, which involves heavier springs and the inclusion of dumbbells.</p>
<p>A <b>single class</b> costs <b>$45</b>. First-timers can get their<b> Intro Experience ($69)</b> which gives you access to 2 classes of your choosing. If you get hooked, you can pay <b>$89/week</b> for <b>unlimited access</b> to as many classes as you wish, across their 4 studios. Do note that you’ll have to commit to a 12-week package for this, though, so it’s most suitable for the most hardcore of pilates junkies.</p>
<p><b>Types of pilates available: </b>Reformer</p>
<p><b>Strong Pilates review:</b> “The studio is very well-managed and well-maintained, and the front desk team is swift and friendly when providing assistance. The trainers provide specific instructions and explain the rationales behind each move thoroughly. They are also very encouraging, and provide tips on how to avoid injury.”<br />

<p><b>Pilates Motiv</b> is a cosy boutique studio for the Easties. It’s located along the East Coast Road stretch of eateries, ensuring that you’ll have no lack of options for post-class chow once you’ve worked up a massive appetite.</p>
<p>They have <b>group classes ($60/session)</b> targeting specific fitness goals like Tone &amp; Lengthen, Stretch &amp; Sculpt with variations working your choice of upper or lower body, and Sweat for a full-body burn. Get your hands on an <b>Intro Package</b> <b>($130)</b> for access to <b>3 group classes</b>, valid for 1 month.</p>
<p><b>Types of pilates available: </b>Mat, reformer, chair</p>
<p><b>Pilates Motiv review:</b> “Good class size and the instructors were clear in their coaching. However, the studio is a little dirty, with clumps of hair everywhere. They seem to have a mosquito issue as well, with mozzies seen at the studio entrance as well as during class itself. Hope to see them improving on cleanliness!”<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s all about the ebb and flow of the body at </span><b>The Moving Body</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Besides their pilates classes, the studio also has gyrotonic starter classes and physiotherapy sessions that are open to children too. And with 3 studios accessibly located around Singapore, there’s really no reason to skip a session here. </span></p>
<p>Snag a 50% off deal by booking a <b>private 1-to-1 trial class </b>at<b> $74 (U.P. $148)</b>, applicable for both reformer or Gyrotonic sessions. If you like what you see, you can purchase <b>group class</b> credits at <b>$57 per session</b>.</p>
<p><b>Types of pilates available:</b> Reformer, specialised equipment (Gyrotonic machines)</p>
<p><b>The Moving Body review:</b> &#8220;I take pilates and Gyrotonic classes here, with instructors Sheryl and Teresa. They are both lovely and I enjoy all my classes with them &#8211; almost addicted! The studio has a nice learning environment, and it&#8217;s very quiet and well-equipped. Clean towels and cold water are also provided!”<br />

<p><b>The VIVA Group review:</b> &#8220;My favorite go-to place for self care in Singapore! I started going for pilates at VIVA almost 2 years ago and fell in love with pilates all over again. I fixed all my past injuries and posture. Everyone is so, so nice and the service is 10/10 every time.”<br />

<p>Followers of local fitness influencer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itzeugena/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@itzeugena</a> will know that she reopened her pilates studio, <b>BE Studios</b>, after Covid-19. They offer group classes for mat work, where prices start from <b>$55/</b><b>class</b>. And while most studios have a 3-month expiration date for class packages, BE Studios’ packages are valid for up to 9 months, if you opt for the shareable <b>50-class package ($1,599)</b>.</p>
<p>First-timers can sign up for their <b>Group Class Trial</b> at <b>$70 for 2 sessions</b>. Busy bees will appreciate the Lunch Crunch class, which is a quick 45-minute midday session designed to energise you and perk you up for the rest of the work day.</p>
<p><b>Types of pilates available:</b> Mat, reformer, chair, Cadillac</p>
<p><b>BE Studios review:</b> &#8220;I started pilates as a post-op rehab option to slowly get back into working out, and fast forward to 4 months later, I look forward to class every week! I love how my instructor designs each class to be slightly different from the rest. The instructors are all so patient, and professional yet friendly.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hot” pilates might just be the new hot </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thang</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For the uninitiated, imagine you’re doing pilates in a sauna &#8211; but </span><b>Jal Yoga</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses infrared panels instead so the room is less stuffy. Benefits are aplenty for this form of pilates, including improved circulation, detoxification of the body, and pain-relieving effects. </span></p>
<p>This concept is still pretty rare in Singapore, so it’s worth a try to see if you’re up for this interesting workout class. And with 6 studios located at Alexandra, Bukit Timah, Katong, Kovan, Thomson, and Woodlands, you’ll be able to easily find a class to join. Get in touch with the studio to redeem a <b>starter package </b>at <strong>$48 for 3 sessions</strong>. Afterwards, you can get individual class credits<b> from</b> <b>$25-$45/session</b> depending on the type of class, or purchase an <b>unlimited class pass from $137/month</b>.</p>
<p><b>Types of pilates available:</b> Mat, mat with infrared heat</p>
<p><b>Jal Yoga review:</b> &#8220;The Woodlands outlet is a small studio which only has 1 class at a time. The classes are great! I&#8217;m a total beginner but the instructor ensured that I could keep up. I get such a good workout here. The admin staff are very friendly and helped with finding the best package for me. The only downsides are that my package can only be used in Woodlands so I can&#8217;t try other outlets, and the weekday night classes get fully booked really fast.”<br />

<p>Admittedly, certain parts of our body need more work than others. <b>BodyLove Pilates</b> has spiced up their classes and structured them to specifically target various muscle groups, so you can focus on your desired body parts.</p>
<p>For example, you can go for the <b>Sculp, Tone, and Challenge!</b> to work your core, tone your triceps, and even give your tush a lift. <b>Group classes</b> start at <b>$55</b><b>/class</b>, and <b>private sessions</b> go from <b>$130/class</b>.</p>
<p><b>Types of pilates available:</b> Reformer</p>
<p><b>BodyLove Pilates review:</b> &#8220;I really enjoy my classes. The instructors are both professional and friendly and the classes cater to my needs even though they are group classes. The small class size also ensures a cosy and conducive environment for the instructors to check that we are actually doing the exercises correctly.”<br />

<p>We’re talking about the basics here at <b>Pilates Flow</b>. No additional jumps, kicks, or equipment – the classes here stick to the traditional pilates work which is great for beginners looking to try out a new form of workout.</p>
<p>The studio only holds <b>private (</b><b>$160</b><b>/session) </b>and <b>duet ($210/session, for 2 pax)</b> equipment classes, and this is to ensure that every participant is given proper guidance to mitigate injuries. Even their group mat work classes are small, kept to a maximum of 6 per class. A <b>1-to-1 trial session</b> goes for <b>$60</b>.</p>
<p><b>Types of pilates available:</b> Reformer, chair, Cadillac</p>
<p><b>Pilates Flow review:</b> &#8220;I did my first ever pilates class with them and I have never regretted it since! The studio is well-equipped and clean. The instructors are very encouraging, patient, and listen to my needs. They push me quite hard sometimes but I never feel forced.”<br />

<p>Besides employing reformer and Cadillac equipment in their classes,  <b>Line Pilates </b>also incorporate a wide range of props such as pilates circles, weight balls, resistance bands, jumping boards, foam rollers, and bosu balance trainers. The various gear effectively targets different muscle groups, allowing you to achieve a more comprehensive workout.</p>
<p>They have a sharing plan for <b>private classes (from </b><b>$106.70</b><b>/session for 60 sessions)</b>, and you can split the sessions with your pal. But if you’re good with going for group classes, the place also has <b>group sessions from</b> <b>$45</b><b>/class</b> – pretty affordable given its central location in Orchard. Try out their <b>Starter Package</b> which gets you <b>3 group sessions for $150</b>.</p>
<p>And for our Korean-speakers, Line Pilates has sessions that are conducted solely in Korean. <i>Daebak</i>!</p>
<p><b>Types of pilates available:</b> Reformer, chair, Cadillac</p>
<p><b>Line Pilates review:</b> &#8220;The instructors are nice and helpful. Class sizes are kept small, at just 3 students for each session. Remember to bring your own grip socks, otherwise you have to buy a pair from the studio at $32 per pair.”<br />

<h3><b>How many times a week is it ideal to go for pilates?</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>3 times a week is usually the recommended schedule for pilates if you want to see a difference in your body strength and tone. However, if you already have a regular exercise routine, then going to pilates once or twice weekly is sufficient.</p>
<hr />
<h3><b>Is pilates alone enough exercise?</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>The short answer is that it depends. If your primary goal is to maintain your overall health, then it’s perfectly fine to have pilates be the only exercise that you do. However, for more specific fitness or weight loss goals, it might be better to pair your pilates routine with other forms of physical activity, such as cardio or strength training.</p>
<hr />
<h3><b>What is the</b><b> difference between yoga </b><b>&amp;</b><b> pilates?</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>Pilates focuses on enhancing body control and muscle endurance, while yoga is grounded in spiritual practices that establish a connection between the body, mind, and spirit through a flowing sequence of movements.</p>
<p>Additionally, yoga tends to place more emphasis on improving your flexibility and deep breathing techniques. It also tackles broader muscle groups while pilates is widely known for core strength, with most movements stemming from the centre of the body.</p>
<hr />
<h6><b>Check out these pilates studios in Singapore</b></h6>
<hr />
<p>Achieve your toned body goals without worrying about bulking up with these pilates studios in Singapore. Hop on the pilates bandwagon and sign up for a class to get started on your new fitness journey. Depending on your budget or workout preference, you’ll definitely be able to find one that suits you best. <i>Xoxo, pilates girl</i>.</p>

<hr />
<p>Fellow <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/gamers-in-singapore/">gamers</a>, listen up. After more than 7 years of waiting, the <b>Nintendo Switch 2</b> is finally making its way to our shores &#8211; expected to land on <strong>26th June 2025</strong>. Here’s everything you need to know about it, from A to Z.</p>
<hr />
<h3><b>What we know about the Nintendo Switch 2 so far</b></h3>
<hr />
<p><i><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-357543" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-big-screen-min.png" alt="gaming experience on the Nintendo Switch 2 " width="589" height="673" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-big-screen-min.png 589w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-big-screen-min-263x300.png 263w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-big-screen-min-131x150.png 131w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /><br />

<p>The Switch 2 differs from its predecessor in almost every aspect. Check out the table below for a comparison of key features that most gamers care about, from screen size to internal storage. Of course, if you’re after the full specs breakdown, head over to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/tech-specs/?srsltid=AfmBOorH9XnM9dbs-npWFpFBzHejjgBaNWVaK32dnsqUs0NezWmfMmMA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo website</a>.</p>

<p>Even though the Switch 2 is bigger and better in most ways, it’s not bulkier &#8211; it’s still the same 13.9mm thick as the OG model. The Joy-Con controllers have gotten a glow-up too, with bigger buttons for easier pressing, and they now attach magnetically. Heck, they can even be used like a mouse, opening up new possibilities to navigate games like <i>Mario Kart </i>or <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>.</p>

<p>On that note, there’s a slew of new <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/multiplayer-nintendo-switch-games/">Nintendo games</a> lined up, such as <i>Mario Kart World</i> and <i>Donkey Kong Bonanza</i>, among others. Existing games like <i>Kirby and the Forgotten Land </i>will also be getting the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades &#8211; basically the same game, but <i>zhnged </i>up with all the fancy features and settings of the Switch 2.</p>
<p><i><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-357542" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-stable-stand-and-docking-to-tv-min.png" alt="adjustable stable stand &amp; docking for the Nintendo Switch 2 " width="1500" height="785" srcset="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-stable-stand-and-docking-to-tv-min.png 1500w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-stable-stand-and-docking-to-tv-min-300x157.png 300w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-stable-stand-and-docking-to-tv-min-1024x536.png 1024w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-stable-stand-and-docking-to-tv-min-150x79.png 150w, https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-stable-stand-and-docking-to-tv-min-768x402.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" />Image adapted from: Nintendo, @impulsegamingpg via Instagram</i></p>
<p>Gone are the days when you’d have to prop your Switch up against random household items just to get a decent view. The new adjustable stable stand lets you find the best viewing angle up to 150 degrees. Alternatively, just dock the Switch to your TV’s HDMI port, and enjoy gaming in glorious 4K resolution.</p>
<p>Other new features include a built-in microphone to interact with your gaming buddy and a 3D spatial audio system when tethered to headphones. The console now has 2 USB-C ports too, so you can charge it while it&#8217;s docked to the TV.</p>
<hr />
<h3><b>How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 alone is priced at <b>$796.50</b>, with the new <i>Mario Kart World</i> game costing USD$79.99 (~S$102.93), adding up to<b> $899.43</b> total. Yikes. However, you can slash that price down all the way to <b>$769</b>, with Amazon’s <a href="https://amzn.to/4jx7Flc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</b></a>, available for pre-order. In our eyes, you’re getting way more for a lot less with this deal, saving more than $130 in the process.</p>
<p>You can also pre-order it from FairPrice, with their <a href="https://www.fairprice.com.sg/product/pre-order-nintendo-switch-2-console-mario-kart-world-bundle?srsltid=AfmBOorvUhNzVAI0wyCJeuC-D3K92LQdvP7JTZY6kf2DVMfqWFn7w-0f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Nintendo Switch 2 Console Mario Kart World Bundle</b></a> priced at <b>$809 (U.P. $849)</b> up for grabs until <b>15th June 2025</b>.</p>
<p>Regardless of which retailer you buy from, these are the following items that you’ll get in the bundle:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Nintendo Switch 2 Console</li>
<li aria-level="1">Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter</li>
<li aria-level="1">Mario Kart World full game (download code)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Joy-Con 2 (L) in light blue and Joy-Con 2 (R) in light red</li>
<li aria-level="1">USB-C charging cable</li>
<li aria-level="1">Nintendo Switch 2 Dock</li>
<li aria-level="1">Joy-Con 2 Grip</li>
<li aria-level="1">2 Joy-Con 2 Straps</li>
</ul>
<p>While the official launch date globally is on 5th June 2025, we Singaporeans have to wait a tad bit longer as it’ll only arrive on <b>26th June 2025</b>. Good things come to those who are patient, though. Once the console lands, you&#8217;ll be able to experience all the next-gen gaming goodness it has to offer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>Things to do at Haji Lane, Singapore</b></h2>
<hr />
<p><b>Haji Lane</b>. Ask any millennial and they’ll tell you fond stories about nights out at its lively bars or about how they found a cool vintage store they thrifted their favourite ‘fits from. But despite Haji Lane being one of the most <i>pops</i> spots in the Bugis area, there are still things we may have missed the last time we hung out there with the <i>kakis</i>.</p>
<p>From vintage stores and DIY leather goods to dessert cafes, here’s what to do in Haji Lane, Singapore during your next get-together.</p>

<hr />
<h3><strong><b>When is the best time to go to Haji Lane?</b></strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>It’s best to go to Haji Lane in the late morning or afternoon, as most shops usually start opening around 11am. However, if you’d like to explore the street art without the bustling crowd, you might prefer getting an earlier start in the morning instead.</p>
<p>If you’re there to check out the bars and restaurants, then evenings are a better time because most of the eateries have outdoor seating along the inner lanes. Plus, you’ll get to enjoy live music at certain places during dinner.</p>
<p>As with most places, Haji Lane can get quite packed on weekends so it’s better to make your visits on weekdays.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong><b>How to get to Haji Lane</b></strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>You can take the MRT via the East-West (EW12) or Downtown (DT14) Line and get off at Bugis Station. Then make a 10-minute walk to reach Haji Lane.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could take the bus, as several routes stop nearby. These include buses 10, 100, 133, 197, 33, 851, 851E, and 857.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><b>– </b><b>Shops</b><b> &amp; activities at </b><b>Haji Lane, Singapore</b><b> –</b></strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>Whether you’re a fashion girlie who’s working on their next upcycling project, or an animal lover keen on visiting the different cat or dog cafes, here are some activities and shops to check out at Haji Lane.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong><b>1. Solace Studios</b></strong></h3>
<hr />
<h4><b>Aeroplane-themed photobooth for $10</b></h4>
<hr />

<p><i>Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?</i> Maybe not, but we can pretend we’re aboard a plane at <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/solace-studios-photobooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Solace Studios</b></a>. This place has been designed to look like you’re about to jet set with a photo booth that resembles a plane lavatory with 0.5 camera angle.</p>
<p>There’s also a check-in counter and props like a suitcase and passport cover to make the illusion as realistic as possible. Even your printed <b>photo strips ($10)</b> feature a boarding pass. All you gotta do is show up in your best airport look and snap away.</p>

<p>The feline friends you’ll meet at <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/meomi-cat-cafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Meomi Cat Cafe</b></a> in Haji Lane are <i>impawsibly </i>cute. Rates start at <b>$14/adult</b> and <b>$7/child</b> with a complimentary drink for the first hour. Every half hour after that will cost you an additional <b>$5/adult</b> and <b>$3/child</b>.</p>
<p>Plus, you can grab a bite from their in-house cafe if you plan to stay longer, with snacks such as <b>Belgium Chocolate Cake ($6.50)</b> and <b>Belgium Waffles ($4)</b>. If you want something more filling, go for their <b>Roast Chicken Croissant ($6)</b> and wash it down with an assortment of <b>teas ($2)</b> or <b>coffees ($2-$4)</b>.</p>

<p>We’ve all turned to our trusty pints of Guinness or Heineken, but switch things up with craft beers on tap at <b>Black Sheep &amp; Co</b>. They’ve got beers from London, the US, and even their own local brew. This cosy bar is a great place for a chill drinking session and a bit less <i>havoc </i>than some of the other bars in the area.</p>

<p>For those who enjoy IPAs, the <b>Hazy Jane (</b><b>$16</b><b>/pint)</b> is a light beer from England with fruity notes. Wine lovers can try the <b>Marques De Caceres Rioja ($12/glass)</b>, which has berry and floral notes.</p>
<p>Drinking on an empty stomach is a recipe for a hectic night out, so order some light bites like<b> truffle fries ($11.90)</b> and<b> ham croquettes ($12.90)</b> to complement your drinks.</p>

<p>With a name like <b>Habibi-san</b>, one would be curious as to just what kind of food to expect. Their menu features a blend of Middle Eastern and Japanese flavours, as well as daily specials for something new with each visit.</p>
<p>Their <b>Babaganoush ($14) </b>isn’t just your usual eggplant and tahini – it comes with a Japanese sesame sauce as well as fried chicken skin on top to give it an extra depth of flavour. You’ve also got the <b>Seaweed Chicken Tsukune ($14) </b>that’s meatballs and shawarma paired with citrussy yuzu mayo and roasted seaweed.</p>
<p><i><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" decoding="async" src="https://thesmartlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Things-to-do-at-Haji-Lane-dining-hall.png" />The restaurant has seating options for various group sizes too.</i><i><br />
</i><i>Image adapted from: @thetravellingspud via Instagram </i></p>
<p>Those who simply don’t know what to choose can opt for their <b>omakase </b>experience <b>($88 per guest)</b>, where the chefs will pick out dishes for you to try. You’ll need a partner in crime though, as a minimum of 2 guests is required.</p>

<p>The colourful lights and neon decor at <b>Piedra Negara </b>naturally draw a crowd, making it one of Haji Lane’s more popular eateries. Whether it’s for a night out over drinks or a hearty dinner, Piedra Negara is a great option for fans of Mexican cuisine.</p>
<p>Their sizable portions will get you your money’s worth, so order some loaded <b>Nachos </b><b>(from $12.90)</b> or <b>Enchiladas </b><b>(from $14.90)</b> to share with the gang.</p>

<p>Fresh guac is a must-have – especially so at Piedra Negra where the staff make it right in front of you. Using a mortar and pestle, they’ll grind the ingredients right at your table, so you know it’s as fresh as it can get. They’ve also got live performances on Friday nights, so take a mini Mexican vacation to celebrate your next TGIF.</p>

<p>As you can probably gather from the name, <b>The French American Bakery</b> sells an assortment of French and American pastries ranging from New York-style cookies to classic croissants and danishes. They went viral on TikTok for their hot chocolate, which features a generous topping of torched marshmallow.</p>

But if you’re not that big a fan of chocolate, you can’t go wrong with other crowd favourites at this Haji Lane bakery like the kouign-amann and creme brulee.

<h3><strong><b>Things to know before you go to Haji Lane</b></strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>Before making plans to go to Haji Lane, there are a few things to take note of. Firstly, while most businesses do accept credit cards, it’s better to carry some extra cash on you, especially if you’re shopping at smaller vendors.</p>
<p>Secondly, though the lane is open for the entire day and many of the F&amp;B establishments are open till late, a lot of the retail stores have limited operating hours, so be sure to check before heading down.</p>
<hr />
<h6><b>What to do in Haji Lane</b><b>, Singapore</b></h6>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/shopping-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopping in Singapore</a> at malls or heading down to Clarke Quay for nightlife has been the go-to for many visitors and locals. And while Haji Lane is up there on the list for a lot of us, check out its lesser-known spots and you might just end up finding a new corner for you and your friends to call your own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>Go Green SG 2025</b></h2>
<hr />
<p>In light of the recent weather, one propaganda that we’re willingly falling for is the idea that global warming is most definitely real. There’s only so much our trusty <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/portable-fans/">portable fans</a> that shoot out wind with the roar of a jet engine can do before we melt into a puddle of our own perspiration.</p>
<p>But, learning how we can go about saving the planet and consequently, alleviating our heat-induced angst, doesn’t have to be a drag. <b>Go Green SG 2025</b> is a government initiative that features a slew of fascinating, sustainability-centric activities, workshops, and tours. Here’s all you need to know about having some eco-friendly fun this June holidays.</p>

<hr />
<h3><b>What is Go Green SG 2025?</b></h3>
<hr />
<div class="video-container">							<lite-youtube videoid="aUnf18Or-Bo" playlabel="MSE GGSG 2024 wrap up"></lite-youtube>
			</div>
<p><i>A quick recap on last year’s edition of Go Green SG.</i></p>
<p>Go Green SG is a movement led by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment to encourage the nation to adopt practices that lead towards a more environmentally sustainable Singapore.</p>
<p>Go Green SG 2025 gives participants opportunities to learn more about how they can become environmentally-conscious citizens through activities conducted by over 400 partnering organisations. This year, its various experiences will be conducted from <b>16th May to 29th June 2025</b>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><b>What to expect from Go Green SG 2025?</b></h3>
<hr />
<p>As mentioned, there’ll be a ton of sustainability-related experiences that you can sign up for under the Go Green SG 2025 movement. They cater to participants of all ages, and a bunch of them are even free to sign up for. From behind-the-scenes looks at facilities not usually open to the public to kid-friendly craft workshops to get the little ones involved, here are just a few of the activities to sign up for.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center"><b>&#8211; Free activities &#8211;</b></h3>
<hr />
<h4><b>Visit to Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm tour</b></h4>

<p>Thanks to Go Green SG 2025, you’ll be able to get a firsthand look at facilities that contribute to building a green Singapore, such as the <b>Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm</b>.</p>

<p>It’s a huge cluster of over 122,000 floating solar panels right next to the Tuas Checkpoint that produces enough electricity to power 16,000 4-room HDB flats annually. On the tour, you’ll get to see the solar panels for yourself via a boat ride, and also discover the biodiversity surrounding the 45-hectare wide farm.</p>

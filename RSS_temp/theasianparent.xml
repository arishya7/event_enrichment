<p data-start="582" data-end="930">When Hailey Bieber graced the cover of Vogue France earlier this year, the spotlight should’ve been on her. But it wasn’t—at least not for the right reasons. In a moment that went viral, her husband, Justin Bieber, reportedly made a sarcastic remark about the shoot, leading fans to speculate that he wasn&#8217;t entirely supportive of her solo success.</p>
<p data-start="932" data-end="1185">Fast forward just weeks later, and Hailey is the one making headlines again—but this time, it&#8217;s for something far bigger: her beauty brand Rhode is reportedly being acquired by ELF Beauty in a deal valued at US$1.1 billion (approximately S$1.5 billion).</p>
<p data-start="1187" data-end="1364">And just like that, Hailey didn’t need to defend herself. She didn’t post a Notes app message or clap back in an interview. She just let her billion-dollar brand do the talking.</p>
<p data-start="1366" data-end="1854">Hailey Bieber launched Rhode in 2022 with a clear vision: clean, minimalist skincare that worked. Despite early skepticism from critics who called it “just another celebrity beauty line,” Rhode quickly became a Gen Z favourite, selling out multiple times and gaining cult status for products like the Peptide Lip Treatment and Glazing Milk. Hailey herself remained the face and creative force behind the brand, ensuring her voice—soft-spoken but certain—carried through in every campaign.</p>
<p data-start="1856" data-end="2118">The ELF deal cements her not just as a founder, but a serious businesswoman. According to reports, Hailey will remain involved with the brand even after the acquisition, signalling that this isn’t a celebrity cash-out—it’s a strategic move to scale even further.</p>
<p data-start="2120" data-end="2492">What makes this moment resonate isn’t just the billion-dollar number—it’s the contrast. From being side-eyed on her own cover shoot to standing at the helm of one of the year’s biggest beauty acquisitions, Hailey’s rise is a reminder that silence can be strength, and building something of your own is the best response to being underestimated—even by people close to you.</p>
<p data-start="2494" data-end="2705">In a world that still often defines women by who they’re with, Hailey is showing the power of betting on yourself. And for every woman who’s ever been told she’s “just someone’s wife,” this story hits different.</p>
<p data-start="2707" data-end="2764">After all, success may not be loud—but it’s always heard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="285" data-end="519">On her 11th birthday, young Trixia Anne Arellano did something extraordinary—she broke a national record in the 200-metre dash at a major youth sports event in the Philippines. What made her win even more remarkable? She ran barefoot.</p>
<p data-start="521" data-end="857">Representing Western Visayas in the Philippines&#8217; 65th Palarong Pambansa (a national student-athlete competition similar to Singapore&#8217;s National School Games), Trixia finished the 200-metre race in just 26.40 seconds—surpassing a 17-year-old record. The next day, she added another gold medal to her name by winning the 100-metre sprint.</p>
<p data-start="859" data-end="1168">But beyond the medals and broken records, it was how she won that captured hearts across the region. Trixia had worn shoes in the preliminary rounds and didn’t win. But during the finals, she made the bold decision to go barefoot—something she felt more comfortable with, and the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p data-start="1170" data-end="1572">Her story is a powerful reminder to parents everywhere that sometimes, the best thing we can do is support our children in finding their own stride—literally and figuratively. Whether it’s allowing them to try something unconventional, or backing their decisions that may seem unusual at first glance, Trixia’s triumph shows us that confidence, self-awareness, and heart can make a world of difference.</p>
<p data-start="1574" data-end="1868">As Singaporean parents raising children in an increasingly competitive world, it’s easy to focus on results—be it academic scores or performance in co-curricular activities. But stories like Trixia’s remind us that resilience, self-belief, and the courage to be different are just as important.</p>
<p data-start="1870" data-end="2020">So the next time your child wants to try something their own way (within safe limits, of course), it might just be the beginning of a winning journey.</p>

While <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/milk-for-pregnancy" >cow’s milk</a> is a common staple in pregnancy diets, goat milk is gaining traction among health-conscious moms. Known for its easy digestibility and rich nutrient profile, many wonder: Is goat milk good for pregnancy?</p>
<p>This article dives deep into the facts, separating myth from reality and helping you make informed, bump-friendly choices.</p>

<strong data-start="918" data-end="974">Nutritional Benefits of Goat Milk During Pregnancy</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969395" class="wp-caption-text">Goat Milk During Pregnancy: Is It Safe and Nutritious?</p>

<strong data-start="980" data-end="1025">1. A Powerful Dose of Essential Nutrients</strong>
<p data-start="1027" data-end="1097">Goat milk is packed with key nutrients that support both mom and baby:</p>


<p data-start="1100" data-end="1159"><strong data-start="1100" data-end="1111">Calcium</strong> – Crucial for fetal bone and tooth development.</p>


<p data-start="1162" data-end="1229"><strong data-start="1162" data-end="1175">Vitamin A</strong> – Supports healthy skin, vision, and immune function.</p>


<p data-start="1232" data-end="1305"><strong data-start="1232" data-end="1259">Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)</strong> – Promotes energy production and cell growth.</p>


<p data-start="1308" data-end="1373"><strong data-start="1308" data-end="1319">Protein</strong> – Aids in the formation of baby’s organs and tissues.</p>


<strong data-start="1379" data-end="1416">2. Easier on the Digestive System</strong>
<p data-start="1418" data-end="1494">Many expectant moms find goat milk easier to digest than cow’s milk because:</p>


<p data-start="1497" data-end="1564">It contains smaller fat globules, leading to quicker digestion.</p>


<p data-start="1567" data-end="1767">It has less alpha-casein, a protein that some people find difficult to process.</p>


<p>This makes goat milk a possible solution for those with mild lactose sensitivities though it’s not lactose-free.</p>
<strong data-start="1773" data-end="1804">3. Boosts the Immune System</strong>
<p data-start="1806" data-end="1967">Goat milk naturally contains bioactive compounds like selenium and zinc that can help strengthen the immune system, which undergoes changes during pregnancy.</p>
<p data-start="1806" data-end="1967"> </p>
<strong data-start="1977" data-end="2011">Things to Be Cautious About</strong>
<strong data-start="2017" data-end="2056">1. Pasteurization is Non-Negotiable</strong>
<p data-start="2058" data-end="2205"><strong data-start="2058" data-end="2107">Never consume raw goat milk during pregnancy.</strong> It can contain dangerous bacteria like <em data-start="2147" data-end="2157">Listeria</em>, <em data-start="2159" data-end="2171">Salmonella</em>, or <em data-start="2176" data-end="2185">E. coli</em>, which can lead to:</p>


<p data-start="2208" data-end="2219">Miscarriage</p>


<p data-start="2222" data-end="2237">Premature labor</p>


<p data-start="2240" data-end="2328">Severe illness for both mother and baby<br data-start="2279" data-end="2282" /><br />
<strong data-start="2282" data-end="2328">Always opt for pasteurized goat milk only.</strong></p>


<strong data-start="2334" data-end="2364">2. Watch for Fortification</strong>
<p data-start="2366" data-end="2501">Unlike commercial cow’s milk, goat milk may <strong data-start="2410" data-end="2443">lack folic acid and vitamin D</strong> unless it’s fortified. These nutrients are essential for:</p>


<p data-start="2504" data-end="2552">Preventing birth defects (especially folic acid)</p>


<p data-start="2555" data-end="2694">Supporting calcium absorption and immune health (vitamin D)<br data-start="2614" data-end="2617" /><br />
Choose fortified versions or ensure your prenatal vitamins cover these needs.</p>


<strong data-start="2700" data-end="2724">3. Allergy Awareness</strong>
<p data-start="2726" data-end="2931">While goat milk proteins are different from cow milk, they can still trigger allergies. If you’ve had dairy sensitivities or allergies in the past, consult your doctor before adding goat milk to your diet.</p>
<p data-start="2726" data-end="2931"> </p>
<strong data-start="2941" data-end="2996">How Much Goat Milk Can You Drink While Pregnant?</strong>
<p data-start="2998" data-end="3142">Most health professionals recommend <strong data-start="3034" data-end="3058">1–2 servings per day</strong> (about one cup each) as part of a balanced prenatal diet. Goat milk can be used in:</p>


<p data-start="3145" data-end="3154">Smoothies</p>


<p data-start="3157" data-end="3174">Cereal or oatmeal</p>


<p data-start="3177" data-end="3194">Cooking or baking</p>


<p data-start="3197" data-end="3222">Homemade yogurt or cheese</p>



<strong data-start="3232" data-end="3273">Expert Tip: Speak With Your Doctor</strong>
<p data-start="3275" data-end="3514">Every pregnancy is unique. While goat milk can be highly nutritious, it’s essential to discuss dietary choices with your OB-GYN or dietitian, especially if you’re managing gestational diabetes, hypertension, or any digestive disorders.</p>
<p data-start="3275" data-end="3514"> </p>
<strong data-start="220" data-end="259">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</strong>
<strong data-start="265" data-end="316">1. Is goat milk safe to drink during pregnancy?</strong>
<p data-start="319" data-end="490">Yes, as long as it is pasteurized, goat milk is generally safe to consume during pregnancy. It provides valuable nutrients such as calcium, protein, and vitamin A.</p>
<strong data-start="496" data-end="557">2. What are the benefits of goat milk for pregnant women?</strong>
<p data-start="560" data-end="754">Goat milk is rich in essential nutrients, easier to digest than cow&#8217;s milk for some women, and supports immune function. It can help with fetal development, energy levels, and digestive comfort.</p>
<strong data-start="760" data-end="814">3. Can goat milk cause allergies during pregnancy?</strong>
<p data-start="817" data-end="1007">While rare, some people can be allergic to goat milk proteins. If you have a known dairy allergy or experience symptoms like bloating or skin reactions, consult your doctor before consuming.</p>
<strong data-start="1013" data-end="1071">4. Is goat milk better than cow milk during pregnancy?</strong>
<p data-start="1074" data-end="1279">Goat milk is easier to digest and may be less allergenic for some, but cow milk is often fortified with folic acid and vitamin D. The best choice depends on your nutritional needs and how your body reacts.</p>
<strong data-start="1285" data-end="1349">5. How much goat milk should a pregnant woman drink per day?</strong>
<p data-start="1352" data-end="1517">1–2 cups per day is generally safe, depending on your overall diet. It’s best to incorporate it as part of a balanced meal plan approved by your healthcare provider.</p>
<strong data-start="1523" data-end="1591">6. Should I drink goat milk instead of taking prenatal vitamins?</strong>
<p data-start="1594" data-end="1753">No. Goat milk can complement a healthy pregnancy diet but <strong data-start="1652" data-end="1692">should not replace prenatal vitamins</strong>, which provide essential nutrients like folic acid and iron.</p>
<strong data-start="1759" data-end="1831">7. Can I drink goat milk if I’m lactose intolerant during pregnancy?</strong>
<p data-start="1834" data-end="2010">Goat milk contains less lactose than cow’s milk but still contains some. If you&#8217;re lactose intolerant, speak to your doctor or try lactose-free or plant-based alternatives.</p>
<p data-start="1834" data-end="2010"> </p>
<strong data-start="3524" data-end="3589">Final Thoughts</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969396" class="wp-caption-text">Goat Milk During Pregnancy: Is It Safe and Nutritious?</p>

<p data-start="3591" data-end="4040">Goat milk can be a fantastic addition to your pregnancy diet if it’s pasteurized, fortified, and consumed in moderation. It delivers a rich array of nutrients, supports digestion, and can be a refreshing alternative to traditional dairy.</p>
<p data-start="3591" data-end="4040">However, make sure you’re mindful of potential allergies and nutrient gaps. With the right guidance, this creamy, gentle milk can nourish both you and your baby beautifully throughout your pregnancy journey.</p>

Goat milk is easier to digest and may be less allergenic for some, but cow milk is often fortified with folic acid and vitamin D. The best choice depends on your nutritional needs and how your body reacts.<br />
5. How much goat milk should a pregnant woman drink per day?<br />
1–2 cups per day is generally safe, depending on your overall diet. It’s best to incorporate it as part of a balanced meal plan approved by your healthcare provider.<br />
6. Should I drink goat milk instead of taking prenatal vitamins?<br />
No. Goat milk can complement a healthy pregnancy diet but should not replace prenatal vitamins, which provide essential nutrients like folic acid and iron.<br />
7. Can I drink goat milk if I’m lactose intolerant during pregnancy?<br />
Goat milk contains less lactose than cow’s milk but still contains some. If you're lactose intolerant, speak to your doctor or try lactose-free or plant-based alternatives.<br />
 <br />
Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Goat milk can be a fantastic addition to your pregnancy diet if it’s pasteurized, fortified, and consumed in moderation. It delivers a rich array of nutrients, supports digestion, and can be a refreshing alternative to traditional dairy.<br />
However, make sure you’re mindful of potential allergies and nutrient gaps. With the right guidance, this creamy, gentle milk can nourish both you and your baby beautifully throughout your pregnancy journey.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite all his achievements — being a Cambridge examiner, teaching over 400 students, founding a centre — Kelvin says fatherhood remains his greatest and most humbling role.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="217" data-end="557">With Father’s Day just around the corner, there’s a lot of talk about what it means to be a father — the provider, the protector, the planner. But in real life, none of these roles come with a manual. And as Singaporean parents juggling careers, school stress, and growing kids, we know that sometimes it feels like we’re just winging it.</p>
<p data-start="559" data-end="656">Now imagine doing all that while teaching one of the most feared subjects in school: Chemistry.</p>
<p data-start="658" data-end="1133">Kelvin Ang, former MOE JC teacher, Cambridge examiner, and the founder of The Chemistry Practice, doesn’t just teach Chemistry. He lives the balancing act every father knows well: trying to be present at home while making a difference at work. He’s spent over a decade helping hundreds of students master one of the most complex subjects in the A-Level syllabus. But it wasn’t until he became a father himself that his approach to teaching — and life — truly transformed.</p>
<p data-start="1135" data-end="1378">This Father’s Day, Kelvin offers something a little different. Not a formula. Not a solution. But a reflection on what teaching Chemistry has taught him about being a father, and what being a father has taught him about teaching Chemistry.</p>
 
From Military Control Tower to Classroom (and Then Home)
<p data-start="1446" data-end="1797">Kelvin didn’t start out with a periodic table and whiteboard in hand. In fact, he spent six years as an Air Traffic Controller in the Air Force after national service.</p>

<p data-start="1446" data-end="1797"><em><strong>&#8220;At that point, I started asking myself — is this really what I want to do long-term? I realised maybe it was time to try something I had always wanted to do but never got around to — teaching.&#8221;</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="1446" data-end="1797">The other career tugging at him was teaching — something he had shelved but never truly let go of.</p>
<p data-start="1799" data-end="2042">So, he pivoted. He entered the MOE system, taught in Junior Colleges, and eventually worked at a leading Chemistry tuition centre. And while his students were achieving solid grades — many scoring As and Bs — something else was nagging at him.</p>

<p data-start="2044" data-end="2173"><em><strong>“By having my own centre, I have the freedom to design my own way of teaching — how I want to approach each topic, and what kinds of questions to go through in class. It’s something I’m really proud of, because it allows me to develop and customise everything myself.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2175" data-end="2383">And so in 2021, in the middle of raising two young kids with his wife of 14 years, he launched The Chemistry Practice — a space designed not just for academic achievement, but for deeper learning and support.</p>
</p>

Teaching Chemistry, While Raising Humans
<p data-start="2435" data-end="2591">Ask any parent. Raising kids is an education in itself. But ask a father who’s also a teacher, and he’ll tell you just how intertwined the two really are.</p>

<p data-start="2435" data-end="2591"><em><strong>&#8220;When you&#8217;re handling your own kids, your expectations of them tend to be higher, I would say. I do get a little bit less patient with my kids.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p data-start="2435" data-end="2591"><em><strong>&#8220;Somehow, my wife always comments that I&#8217;m more patient with my students than with my own kids,&#8221;</strong></em> Kelvin laughs.</p>

<p data-start="2803" data-end="2994">It’s a moment many parents can relate to. We expect our own children to “know better” or to behave the way we hope they will. But the truth? Parenting — like Chemistry — is full of variables.</p>

<p data-start="3270" data-end="3455"><em><strong>&#8220;But you learn the way to break down difficult concepts into easier, digestible small bites. So this actually helps me in explaining the difficult concepts to the older kids that I have in the tuition centre.&#8221;</strong></em></p>

 
Why Chemistry is Like Parenting
<p data-start="3530" data-end="3663">If you’ve ever supported your teen through A-Levels, you know Chemistry isn’t just about mixing chemicals and watching things bubble.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969380" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Kelvin Ang</p>


<p data-start="3665" data-end="3940"><em><strong>&#8220;So it is multifaceted, and then you also have organic chemistry, where you need to be able to draw the structures correctly. As a Chemistry teacher, you&#8217;re teaching them a lot of different techniques to solve questions — calculations, drawings, graphing,&#8221;</strong></em> Kelvin explains. <strong><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s really multifaceted; it&#8217;s not just calculation-based. This is what makes Chemistry difficult.&#8221;</em></strong></p>

<p data-start="3942" data-end="3958">Sounds familiar?</p>
<p data-start="3960" data-end="4150">Parenting, too, is a series of evolving challenges. What works at age 4 doesn’t work at 14. And when your child suddenly doesn’t “get” something in school — or life — it’s tempting to panic.</p>
<p data-start="4152" data-end="4197">But Kelvin has a calming counter-perspective.</p>

<p data-start="4199" data-end="4295"><em><strong>&#8220;So while academic achievements are important, they shouldn&#8217;t come at the expense of mental health,&#8221;</strong></em> he says. <em><strong>&#8220;It’s essential for schools, parents, and teachers to work together to find the right balance and to support both the academic goals as well as the mental and emotional health of our children.&#8221;</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="4297" data-end="4447">So he encourages both parents and students to be realistic — but proactive. Be present, ask better questions, and support with patience, not pressure.</p>
 
Real Support for Real Exams
<p data-start="5284" data-end="5429">Let’s get practical for a second. For A-Level Chemistry students, it’s not just about understanding — it’s about recalling tons of information.</p>
<p data-start="5431" data-end="5477">One tool Kelvin swears by? Digital flashcards.</p>

<p data-start="5479" data-end="5655"><em><strong>&#8220;For A-Level Chemistry, they have to remember close to 60 or more reactions,&#8221;</strong></em> he explains. <em><strong>&#8220;That’s where flashcards come in. They help students recall the reactions they must remember. I always tell them, on the way to school, just take 5 to 10 minutes to go through the flashcards. If you do it consistently every day, over time, you&#8217;ll be able to remember all the reactions.&#8221;</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="5657" data-end="5771">It’s a small, doable habit that teaches consistency — something every father hopes to instil in their children.</p>
<p data-start="5773" data-end="6015">He also focuses on exposing students to all levels of questions — easy to brutally difficult — so they don’t panic during the exam. In other words, life skills — disguised as Chemistry prep.</p>
<p data-start="7672" data-end="7988">If your teen is struggling with Chemistry or you simply want them to build real confidence before their A-Levels, check out <a class="" href="https://www.thechemistrypractice.sg" target="_new" rel="noopener" data-start="7796" data-end="7857" >The Chemistry Practice</a>. Kelvin and his team don’t just teach Chemistry — they teach students how to think, apply, and believe in their own ability.</p>

<p data-start="7672" data-end="7988"><em><strong>&#8220;If you’re still struggling with Chemistry at this point and need some guidance or help to improve your results, we’re here to help. We know exactly what the exam requires, and we can help bridge that gap.&#8221;</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="7990" data-end="8135" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">This Father’s Day, maybe the best gift you can give your child… is a little bit more belief. From you, and from the right guidance along the way.</p>
 
Fatherhood, The Hardest and Most Rewarding Subject of All
<p data-start="6144" data-end="6318">Despite all his achievements — being a Cambridge examiner, teaching over 400 students, founding a centre — Kelvin says fatherhood remains his greatest and most humbling role.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969382" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Kelvin Ang</p>


<p data-start="6320" data-end="6493"><em><strong>&#8220;I think finding a balance is never an easy task, because there’s no perfect formula — everyone’s job and work requirements are different.&#8221;</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="6495" data-end="6686">It’s this humility that makes his story so relatable. For Singaporean parents constantly wondering if we’re doing enough, his message is simple: You don’t have to be perfect. Just be present.</p>
<p data-start="6688" data-end="6860">He believes that the most powerful thing a father (or any parent) can do is to keep showing up — with patience, curiosity, and the willingness to grow alongside our kids.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969383" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Kelvin Ang</p>


<p data-start="6688" data-end="6860"><em><strong>&#8220;It’s not just about spending time together — the time needs to be meaningful. For example, my wife and I make it a point that during our meals, we put away our phones so we can have real conversations with the kids — ask them how their day is going, what’s been bothering them, talk about their friends.&#8221;</strong></em></p>

 
Celebrate the Fathers Who Are Still Learning, Too
<p data-start="6937" data-end="7174">This Father’s Day, maybe it’s not about the big gestures or fancy brunches. Maybe it’s about recognising the quiet efforts — the late-night revision sessions, the mini pep talks, the consistent presence even when you’re running on empty.</p>
<p data-start="7176" data-end="7408">Kelvin Ang’s journey proves that fatherhood isn’t about having the perfect formula — it’s about trial and error, controlled chaos, and sometimes just holding the beaker steady while everything else heats up.</p>
<p data-start="7176" data-end="7408">Being a father means being the constant in your child’s life equation, even when their variables are all over the place.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Discover whether full cream milk is safe and beneficial during pregnancy. Learn about its nutritional value, pros and cons, and expert tips for expectant mothers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pregnancy marks a transformative journey. One where every dietary choice can influence the health and development of your growing baby. Among the many foods pregnant women ponder over, <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/milk-for-pregnancy" >milk</a> is a frequent topic of debate. More specifically, is full cream milk good for pregnancy?</p>
<p>While some tout it as a powerhouse of nutrition, others raise concerns about its fat content.</p>
<p>In this article, we explore the benefits, drawbacks, and expert recommendations surrounding the consumption of full cream milk during pregnancy.</p>














<strong data-start="1027" data-end="1077">Benefits of Full Cream Milk During Pregnancy</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969372" class="wp-caption-text">Is Full Cream Milk Good for Pregnancy? Here&#8217;s What You Need to Know</p>

<strong data-start="1083" data-end="1123">1. Nutrient-Rich for Mother and Baby</strong>
<p data-start="1125" data-end="1192">Full cream milk is a natural source of essential nutrients such as:</p>


<p data-start="1195" data-end="1284"><strong data-start="1195" data-end="1206">Calcium</strong>: Supports bone development in the fetus and maintains maternal bone strength.</p>


<p data-start="1287" data-end="1353"><strong data-start="1287" data-end="1298">Protein</strong>: Essential for fetal growth and development of organs.</p>


<p data-start="1356" data-end="1458"><strong data-start="1356" data-end="1373">Vitamin D &amp; A</strong>: Important for immune function, vision, and the formation of healthy skin and bones.</p>


<strong data-start="1464" data-end="1496">2. May Be Fortified with DHA</strong>
<p data-start="1498" data-end="1669">Some full cream milk brands are fortified with <strong data-start="1545" data-end="1575">DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid), </strong>a crucial omega-3 fatty acid known to support brain and nervous system development in babies.</p>
<strong data-start="1675" data-end="1704">3. Enhances Energy Levels</strong>
<p data-start="1706" data-end="1855">Thanks to its higher fat and calorie content, full cream milk offers an energy boost that can help combat fatigue often experienced during pregnancy.</p>
<p data-start="1706" data-end="1855"> </p>
<strong data-start="1865" data-end="1903">Potential Drawbacks to Consider</strong>
<strong data-start="1909" data-end="1937">1. High in Saturated Fat</strong>
<p data-start="1939" data-end="2063">Full cream milk has a higher percentage of saturated fat compared to low-fat versions. Consuming it excessively may lead to:</p>


<p data-start="2066" data-end="2093">Unnecessary weight gain</p>


<p data-start="2096" data-end="2128">Increased cholesterol levels</p>


<p data-start="2131" data-end="2180">Higher risk of pregnancy-related hypertension</p>


<strong data-start="2186" data-end="2206">2. Calorie-Dense</strong>
<p data-start="2208" data-end="2364">Each glass of full cream milk contains around 150 calories. For women monitoring their pregnancy weight or with gestational diabetes, this may not be ideal.</p>
<strong data-start="2370" data-end="2414">3. Safety First: Choose Pasteurized Only</strong>
<p data-start="2416" data-end="2601">Unpasteurized milk can harbor harmful bacteria like Listeria, which poses serious risks during pregnancy. Always opt for pasteurized milk to ensure safety for both mom and baby.</p>
<p data-start="2416" data-end="2601"> </p>
<strong data-start="2611" data-end="2640">Expert Recommendations</strong>


<p data-start="2644" data-end="2791"><strong data-start="2644" data-end="2665">Moderation is key</strong>: One to two servings of full cream milk daily is generally considered safe unless advised otherwise by a healthcare provider.</p>


<p data-start="2794" data-end="2933"><strong data-start="2794" data-end="2825">Personalized advice matters</strong>: Every pregnancy is different. Speak with a nutritionist or OB-GYN before making any major dietary changes.</p>


<p data-start="2936" data-end="3126"><strong data-start="2936" data-end="2961">Consider alternatives</strong>: If full cream milk isn’t suitable for you, low-fat milk, lactose-free options, or plant-based milk fortified with calcium and vitamin D are excellent alternatives.</p>



<strong data-start="3136" data-end="3181">Sip Smart, Grow Strong</strong>
</p>

One where every dietary choice can influence the health and development of your growing baby. Among the many foods pregnant women ponder over, milk is a frequent topic of debate. More specifically, is full cream milk good for pregnancy?<br />
While some tout it as a powerhouse of nutrition, others raise concerns about its fat content.<br />
In this article, we explore the benefits, drawbacks, and expert recommendations surrounding the consumption of full cream milk during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Benefits of Full Cream Milk During Pregnancy</p>
<p>1. Nutrient-Rich for Mother and Baby<br />
Full cream milk is a natural source of essential nutrients such as:</p>
<p>Calcium: Supports bone development in the fetus and maintains maternal bone strength.</p>
<p>Protein: Essential for fetal growth and development of organs.</p>
<p>Vitamin D &amp; A: Important for immune function, vision, and the formation of healthy skin and bones.</p>
<p>2. May Be Fortified with DHA<br />
Some full cream milk brands are fortified with DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid), a crucial omega-3 fatty acid known to support brain and nervous system development in babies.<br />
3. Enhances Energy Levels<br />
Thanks to its higher fat and calorie content, full cream milk offers an energy boost that can help combat fatigue often experienced during pregnancy.<br />
 <br />
Potential Drawbacks to Consider<br />
1. High in Saturated Fat<br />
Full cream milk has a higher percentage of saturated fat compared to low-fat versions. Consuming it excessively may lead to:</p>
<p>Unnecessary weight gain</p>
<p>Increased cholesterol levels</p>
<p>Higher risk of pregnancy-related hypertension</p>
<p>2. Calorie-Dense<br />
Each glass of full cream milk contains around 150 calories. For women monitoring their pregnancy weight or with gestational diabetes, this may not be ideal.<br />
3. Safety First: Choose Pasteurized Only<br />
Unpasteurized milk can harbor harmful bacteria like Listeria, which poses serious risks during pregnancy. Always opt for pasteurized milk to ensure safety for both mom and baby.<br />
 <br />
Expert Recommendations</p>
<p>Moderation is key: One to two servings of full cream milk daily is generally considered safe unless advised otherwise by a healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Personalized advice matters: Every pregnancy is different. Speak with a nutritionist or OB-GYN before making any major dietary changes.</p>
<p>Consider alternatives: If full cream milk isn’t suitable for you, low-fat milk, lactose-free options, or plant-based milk fortified with calcium and vitamin D are excellent alternatives.</p>
<p>Sip Smart, Grow Strong</p>
<p>Full cream milk can be a valuable addition to a pregnancy diet, rich in essential nutrients that support both mom and baby.<br />
However, as with all things during pregnancy, balance and personalization are key. Whether you choose full cream or opt for a lighter version, ensuring you're getting adequate nutrients is what truly counts.<br />
Always consult your healthcare provider and make informed decisions that align with your unique health needs. After all, you're not just feeding yourself, you’re nurturing the future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Mental disorders in SG youth are now the leading cause of disability and death among ages 10–14, a new Lancet study reveals. Learn what’s driving the trend and how parents can help.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="266" data-end="403">As parents, we worry about grades, <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/3-6-9-12-method" >screen time</a>, sleep, and nutrition. But how often do we stop to check in on our child’s mental health?</p>
<p data-start="405" data-end="624">A new study published in <em data-start="430" data-end="456">The Lancet Public Health</em> has highlighted something every parent in Singapore needs to hear. Mental disorders are now the leading cause of disability and death among children aged 10 to 14.</p>
<p data-start="626" data-end="676">This isn’t just a statistic. It’s a wake-up call.</p>
<p data-start="626" data-end="676"> </p>
<strong>Alarming Statistics</strong>
<p>In 2021 alone, Singapore recorded approximately 653,000 diagnoses of mental disorders, with prevalence rates at 12.8% for males and 11.7% for females. Among the most commonly reported conditions were anxiety (affecting 185,000 individuals) and depression (144,000 individuals).</p>
<p>The impact is particularly severe among tweens. The 10–14 age group now faces mental illness as the primary contributor to both disability and mortality, a stark contrast to traditional concerns such as infectious diseases or physical injuries.</p>

<strong>Causes Behind the Crisis</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969350" class="wp-caption-text">Mental Disorders Now Leading Health Concern Among Singaporean Tweens, Study Finds</p>

<p>Experts point to several contributing factors:</p>


<p><strong>Academic Pressure and Social Media</strong>: High expectations in school and the 24/7 presence of social media have led to increased stress, performance anxiety, and low self-esteem among children and teens.</p>


<p><strong>Family and Social Changes</strong>: Rising rates of family breakdowns, social isolation, and Westernized societal shifts have also been linked to a growing mental health burden.</p>


<p><strong>The Lingering Impact of COVID-19</strong>: The pandemic disrupted routines, isolated families, and created widespread uncertainty. This is particularly hard on young, developing minds.</p>


<p><em>&#8220;Clinically, mental health challenges often emerge early in life and, if unaddressed, can lead to years of lost potential,&#8221;</em> said Professor Alina Rodriguez from NUS Medicine, one of the collaborators on the paper.</p>

<strong>It’s Not Just Teens: Older Adults at Risk Too</strong>
<p data-start="2066" data-end="2318">The study also found a threefold rise in mental disorders among those aged 70 and above compared to 1990. As people live longer, depression often follows declining physical health, making mental health an important issue across all life stages.</p>
<p data-start="2066" data-end="2318"> </p>
<strong>What Can Parents Do?</strong>


<p data-start="2352" data-end="2442"><strong data-start="2352" data-end="2371">Watch for signs</strong> like mood swings, withdrawal, sleep disturbances, or academic decline.</p>


<p data-start="2446" data-end="2513"><strong data-start="2446" data-end="2469">Start conversations</strong> early about emotions and mental well-being.</p>


<p data-start="2517" data-end="2631"><strong data-start="2517" data-end="2543">Normalize seeking help</strong> — show your child that mental health care is just as important as physical health care.</p>


<p data-start="2635" data-end="2714"><strong data-start="2635" data-end="2648">Reach out</strong> to school counselors, family doctors, or mental health helplines.</p>



<strong>Resources for Parents and Families</strong>
<p>Mental and emotional well-being is just as important as physical health. Parents who suspect their child is struggling with anxiety, depression, or other mental health challenges can access support through various local resources:</p>


<p><strong>IMH Mental Health Helpline</strong>: 6389-2222 (24/7)</p>


<p><strong>Samaritans of Singapore</strong>: 1-767 / WhatsApp 9151-1767 (24/7)</p>


<p><strong>Chat for Youth Mental Health</strong>: 6493-6500/1</p>


<p><strong>mindline.sg</strong> and <strong>tinklefriend.sg</strong> for self-help and chat support</p>


<p data-start="3100" data-end="3388"> </p>
<strong>The Takeaway</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969351" class="wp-caption-text">Mental Disorders Now Leading Health Concern Among Singaporean Tweens, Study Finds</p>

<p data-start="3100" data-end="3388">Raising emotionally strong children means going beyond just physical health and academic achievements. This study is a reminder: mental health is health. If we want to support our children’s growth and potential, it starts with making space for their feelings, struggles, and healing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="105" data-end="470">In a significant advancement for male reproductive health, a new non-hormonal contraceptive implant named <em data-start="211" data-end="217">ADAM</em> has demonstrated <a href="https://trial.medpath.com/news/284e3fb33651a324/novel-non-hormonal-male-contraceptive-adam-shows-two-year-efficacy-in-clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >effectiveness for at least two years</a> in early clinical trials. Developed by U.S.-based biotech company Contraline, this innovation presents a promising alternative to traditional male contraceptive methods like condoms and vasectomies.</p>
<strong data-start="472" data-end="490">How ADAM Works</strong>
<p data-start="492" data-end="642">The <a href="https://www.contraline.com/product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >ADAM implant</a> utilises a water-soluble hydrogel that is injected into the vas deferens—the ducts responsible for transporting sperm. This hydrogel acts as a physical barrier, preventing sperm from mixing with semen during ejaculation. Over time, the hydrogel is designed to naturally dissolve, potentially restoring fertility without the need for surgical intervention.</p>
<p>The implantation procedure is minimally invasive, taking less than 30 minutes and requiring only local anaesthesia. This approach offers a less permanent solution compared to vasectomy and avoids the daily maintenance associated with condoms.</p>
Is the ADAM Implant Safe?
<p data-start="1183" data-end="1462">Yes—early trial data suggests that ADAM is <strong data-start="1226" data-end="1253">safe and well-tolerated</strong>. In a Phase 1 clinical trial with 25 healthy male participants, no serious adverse effects were reported. In fact, the two men who reached the 24-month milestone showed <strong data-start="1423" data-end="1461">no detectable sperm in their semen</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1464" data-end="1644">The implant is also <strong data-start="1484" data-end="1498">reversible</strong>, with the hydrogel expected to dissolve naturally over time. Contraline is actively developing procedures for early removal and reversal as well.</p>
Still Under Critical Trials
<p data-start="1678" data-end="1958">While early results are promising, it’s important to note that <strong data-start="1741" data-end="1785">ADAM is still undergoing clinical trials</strong>. Regulatory approval has been granted for <strong data-start="1828" data-end="1859">Phase 2 trials in Australia</strong>, involving 30–50 participants to further assess the implant’s safety, efficacy, and reversibility.</p>
<p data-start="1960" data-end="2006">Kevin Eisenfrats, CEO of Contraline, shared:</p>
<p data-start="1960" data-end="2006">“There’s a major unmet need for more male contraceptive options. ADAM is designed to be a long-lasting yet reversible alternative to vasectomy, and we’re excited about what the data is showing so far.”</p>
<p data-start="2212" data-end="2325">The company is also working on <strong data-start="2243" data-end="2270">at-home sperm test kits</strong> so users can easily track the implant’s effectiveness.</p>

<p data-start="1763" data-end="2020">Currently, the responsibility for contraception often falls on women, who may experience side effects from hormonal <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/misconceptions-benefits-of-birth-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >birth control</a>.

This cutting-edge technology allows doctors to analyse a newborn’s immune function in under <strong data-start="92" data-end="106">15 minutes</strong>, using only a single drop of blood.</p>
<p data-start="701" data-end="777">This innovation promises to transform early diagnostics in newborn care, offering hope for timely intervention in life-threatening conditions like <strong data-start="147" data-end="157">sepsis</strong> and <strong data-start="162" data-end="197">necrotising enterocolitis (NEC)</strong> — especially crucial for <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/premature-baby-problems" target="_blank" rel="noopener" ><strong data-start="223" data-end="243">premature babies</strong></a>.</p>
<strong data-start="933" data-end="989">The Importance of Early Immune Profiling in Newborns</strong>
<p data-start="1545" data-end="1853">Each year, conditions like <strong data-start="1572" data-end="1590">newborn sepsis</strong> and <strong data-start="1595" data-end="1602">NEC</strong> claim the lives of countless premature infants. These illnesses progress rapidly, yet current diagnostic tools are <strong data-start="1718" data-end="1736">slow, invasive</strong>, and require up to <strong data-start="1756" data-end="1773">1 ml of blood</strong> — a major concern for premature babies with a total blood volume of just 50 ml.</p>
<p data-start="1855" data-end="2301"><em>&#8220;Our goal was to create a diagnostic tool that works within the unique constraints of neonatal care — minimal blood volume, rapid turnaround, and high sensitivity,&#8221; </em>said <strong data-start="2029" data-end="2047">Dr Kerwin Kwek</strong>, Research Scientist at SMART CAMP and SMART AMR. <em>&#8220;BLIPI represents a major step forward by providing clinicians with fast, actionable immune health data using a non-invasive method, where it can make a real difference for newborns in critical care.&#8221;</em></p>

This cutting-edge technology allows doctors to analyse a newborn’s immune function in under 15 minutes, using only a single drop of blood.<br />
This innovation promises to transform early diagnostics in newborn care, offering hope for timely intervention in life-threatening conditions like sepsis and necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) — especially crucial for premature babies.<br />
The Importance of Early Immune Profiling in Newborns<br />
Each year, conditions like newborn sepsis and NEC claim the lives of countless premature infants. These illnesses progress rapidly, yet current diagnostic tools are slow, invasive, and require up to 1 ml of blood — a major concern for premature babies with a total blood volume of just 50 ml.<br />
"Our goal was to create a diagnostic tool that works within the unique constraints of neonatal care — minimal blood volume, rapid turnaround, and high sensitivity," said Dr Kerwin Kwek, Research Scientist at SMART CAMP and SMART AMR. "BLIPI represents a major step forward by providing clinicians with fast, actionable immune health data using a non-invasive method, where it can make a real difference for newborns in critical care."<br />
What Is BLIPI and How Does It Work?<br />
BLIPI uses microfluidic technology to measure how immune cells, particularly white blood cells, respond to infection by analysing changes in their size and flexibility. This provides direct evidence of immune system activity, complementing traditional indicators like CRP levels, white cell counts, and neutrophil ratios.<br />
This real-time immune profiling was validated in a study published in Pediatric Research, where 19 infants — both full-term and premature, were tested at multiple timepoints. Notably, BLIPI detected early immune changes in a premature baby who developed a serious blood infection, showcasing its clinical potential.<br />
Transforming Care in NICUs and Beyond<br />
Because BLIPI is portable and produces results at the bedside, it eliminates the delay and stress of sending blood samples to external labs.<br />
"With BLIPI, a single prick to the baby’s finger or heel can give us rapid insights into the infant’s immune response within minutes," said Assistant Professor Yeo Kee Thai, Senior Consultant at the Department of Neonatology at KKH. "This allows us to tailor treatments more precisely and respond faster to give these fragile babies the best chance at a healthy start not just in their early days, but throughout their lives."<br />
KKH, which cares for about two-thirds of all babies born weighing less than 1,500 grams in Singapore, sees BLIPI as a vital addition to its neonatal care arsenal.<br />

<strong>Is Saffron Milk Safe During Pregnancy?</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969282" class="wp-caption-text">Saffron Milk During Pregnancy: Benefits, Safety, and Best Practices</p>

<p>Yes, saffron milk can be safe during pregnancy when consumed in moderation. The key is dosage. While saffron offers several potential health benefits, excessive intake may lead to uterine contractions, especially in the first trimester.</p>
<p>Most healthcare professionals and nutritionists recommend limiting saffron consumption to 2 to 3 strands per day steeped in milk, particularly after the first trimester. The spice is potent, and more is not always better.</p>
<p>As always, it&#8217;s essential to consult your OB-GYN before adding any herbal or traditional remedies to your prenatal routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions.</p>

<strong>Nutritional Benefits of Saffron Milk</strong>
<strong>Rich in Antioxidants</strong>
<p>Saffron contains powerful antioxidants like crocin, safranal, and kaempferol. These compounds help neutralize free radicals in the body, which can reduce inflammation and boost overall immunity.</p>
<strong>Promotes Healthy Digestion</strong>
<p>Digestive discomfort, including bloating and constipation, is common during pregnancy. Saffron has carminative properties that may soothe the digestive tract and improve metabolism when consumed in small quantities.</p>
<strong>Supports Emotional Well-being and Reduces Stress</strong>
<p>Hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy can affect mood. Saffron is known for its mild antidepressant effects and can help improve mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety and stress.</p>
<p>Clinical studies suggest saffron supplementation may even help with mild to moderate depression.</p>
<strong>May Help with Blood Pressure Regulation</strong>
<p>Some studies suggest saffron may support cardiovascular health by helping to regulate blood pressure and improve circulation. This is particularly helpful during pregnancy when blood volume increases and maintaining healthy blood pressure becomes crucial.</p>

<strong>Cultural Beliefs Around Saffron in Pregnancy</strong>
<p>In many Indian, Persian, and Middle Eastern cultures, saffron milk is traditionally believed to promote a fair complexion in babies, a belief not supported by science. However, its use in pregnancy is culturally linked to enhancing vitality, calming the mind, and nurturing the mother.</p>
<p>While these beliefs persist, modern healthcare professionals emphasize its nutritional rather than cosmetic value.</p>

<strong>Potential Risks of Saffron Milk During Pregnancy</strong>
<strong>Overconsumption and Uterine Contractions</strong>
<p>Saffron in high doses (more than 5 grams) is considered unsafe and may stimulate uterine contractions, potentially leading to preterm labor or miscarriage. Always stick to small quantities, just 2 to 3 strands per serving.</p>
<strong>Allergic Reactions</strong>
<p>Though rare, saffron can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals, including dry mouth, dizziness, or nausea. Discontinue use and consult your doctor if any symptoms appear.</p>
<strong>Impact on Blood Pressure for Sensitive Individuals</strong>
<p>While saffron can help stabilize blood pressure, in some cases, it may cause slight drops. If you are prone to low blood pressure, discuss this with your healthcare provider before use.</p>

<strong>Best Time to Drink Saffron Milk During Pregnancy</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969287" class="wp-caption-text">Saffron Milk During Pregnancy: Benefits, Safety, and Best Practices</p>

<p>Evening is often ideal, as saffron’s calming properties may help with better sleep. It can be introduced safely during the second trimester and continued in moderation through the third.</p>

<strong>FAQs</strong>
1. Can saffron milk help with pregnancy mood swings?
<p>Yes, saffron has natural mood-lifting properties and may help reduce anxiety and emotional stress during pregnancy.</p>
2. Is it safe to drink saffron milk daily during pregnancy?
<p>Yes, but only in small amounts—2–3 strands of saffron per day is the safe recommended limit.</p>
3. When should I start drinking saffron milk while pregnant?
<p>It’s best to start in the second trimester after consulting with your OB-GYN.</p>
4. Does saffron milk affect baby’s complexion?

<p id="caption-attachment-969272" class="wp-caption-text">Is Oat Milk Good for Pregnancy? Nutritional Benefits &amp; Expert Advice</p>

<p>Oat milk brings a lot to the table especially for moms-to-be looking for a gentle, lactose-free milk option.</p>
<strong>1. High in Fiber for Digestive Support</strong>
<p>Pregnancy often slows digestion, leading to bloating and constipation. Oat milk, rich in soluble fiber like beta-glucan, promotes regular bowel movements and a healthy gut.</p>
<strong>2. Fortified with Essential Nutrients</strong>
<p>Most commercial oat milk brands are fortified with:</p>


<p><strong>Calcium and Vitamin D</strong>: For fetal bone development</p>


<p><strong>Vitamin B12</strong>: Supports neurological health</p>


<p><strong>Folic Acid</strong>: Reduces risk of neural tube defects</p>


<strong>3. Heart-Healthy and Low in Saturated Fat</strong>
<p>Oat milk contains heart-supporting compounds like beta-glucans and is naturally low in saturated fats and cholesterol, making it a heart-smart choice during pregnancy.</p>
<strong>4. Gentle on the Stomach and Allergen-Friendly</strong>
<p>Oat milk is lactose-free, making it suitable for women with dairy intolerance. It’s also a safe option for those with soy or nut allergies, provided it’s certified gluten-free if needed.</p>

<strong>Potential Drawbacks and Considerations</strong>
<p>Despite its many benefits, oat milk isn’t perfect.</p>
1. Lower in Protein
<p>Compared to dairy or soy milk, oat milk has less protein. Ensure you’re supplementing with other protein-rich foods like legumes, eggs, or lean meats.</p>
2. Watch for Added Sugars
<p>Some flavored oat milks contain high levels of added sugar. Opt for unsweetened, fortified versions to keep your sugar intake in check.</p>
3. Gluten Cross-Contamination
<p>Though oats are naturally gluten-free, contamination can occur. If you&#8217;re gluten-sensitive, make sure to choose certified gluten-free oat milk.</p>

<strong>Expert Recommendations</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969273" class="wp-caption-text">Is Oat Milk Good for Pregnancy? Nutritional Benefits &amp; Expert Advice</p>

<strong>FAQs</strong>
1. Can I drink oat milk every day while pregnant?
<p>Yes, up to 1–2 servings daily of fortified, unsweetened oat milk is generally considered safe and beneficial.</p>
2. Is oat milk safe in the first trimester?
<p>Yes, its gentle nature and folic acid content support early fetal development and digestion.</p>
3. Does oat milk have enough calcium for pregnancy?
<p>Fortified oat milk typically contains similar calcium levels to cow’s milk. Always check the label.</p>
4. Is oat milk good for gestational diabetes?
<p>Unsweetened oat milk may be suitable due to its fiber content, but always consult your doctor.</p>
5. Can oat milk cause bloating during pregnancy?
<p>It’s generally easy to digest, but those sensitive to fiber or gluten should choose carefully.</p>

<strong>A Comforting Choice With Nutritional Merit</strong>
<p>So, is oat milk good for pregnancy? 100% YES, when chosen wisely. Its fiber content, fortification with essential nutrients, and smooth, comforting texture make it a wonderful addition to many prenatal diets. Just be mindful of added sugars and pair it with protein-rich foods to round out your nutrition.</p>
<p>As always, consult your healthcare provider to tailor your choices to your unique needs. With a little care, oat milk can be more than just a dairy alternative. It can be a nourishing companion on your journey to motherhood.</p>

Soy contains isoflavones, plant compounds that mimic estrogen. Some worry these may affect hormonal balance during pregnancy. However, scientific evidence shows that moderate soy consumption does not pose a risk to maternal or fetal health.<br />
Allergies and Sensitivities<br />
Soy is one of the top eight allergens. If you have a soy allergy or experience symptoms like bloating or hives, it’s best to avoid soy milk and consult your healthcare provider for safe alternatives.<br />
Choosing the Right Type of Soy Milk</p>
<p>Fortified: Look for products enriched with calcium, vitamin D, and B12.</p>
<p>Organic and Non-GMO: Reduces exposure to pesticides and genetically modified ingredients.</p>
<p>Unsweetened: Minimizes added sugar intake, helping control weight and blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Expert Recommendations for Soy Milk Intake<br />
Health professionals including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and dietitians suggest that up to 1–2 servings of soy milk per day is safe and nutritious during pregnancy. It should be consumed as part of a varied and balanced prenatal diet.</p>
<p>How to Incorporate Soy Milk Into Your Pregnancy Diet</p>
<p>Use in smoothies with leafy greens and fruits for a vitamin-packed drink.</p>
<p>Replace dairy milk in oatmeal or cereal.</p>
<p>Use in baking or cooking for creaminess without lactose.</p>
<p>When to Avoid Soy Milk During Pregnancy<br />
Avoid soy milk if you have a diagnosed soy allergy or have been advised by your healthcare provider to limit phytoestrogen intake. Always choose reputable brands and check labels for added sugars and additives.</p>
<p>FAQs<br />
1. Can I drink soy milk every day during pregnancy?<br />
Yes, drinking 1–2 servings of soy milk daily is generally safe and beneficial for pregnant women, provided it's part of a balanced diet.<br />
2. Is soy milk safe during the first trimester?<br />
Yes, soy milk is safe in the first trimester and can support early fetal development due to its folic acid and protein content.<br />
3. What are the alternatives to soy milk during pregnancy?<br />
Almond milk, oat milk, and fortified rice milk are great alternatives if you are allergic to soy or prefer a different taste.<br />
4. Does soy milk increase estrogen levels in pregnancy?<br />
Soy contains phytoestrogens, but studies show that moderate consumption does not significantly affect estrogen levels in pregnant women.<br />
5. Can soy milk cause miscarriage?<br />
There is no scientific evidence linking moderate soy milk consumption to miscarriage. Always consult with your doctor for peace of mind.</p>
<p>Sip Smart, Stay Strong<br />
So, is soy milk good for pregnancy? Absolutely! When chosen wisely and consumed in moderation, it can be a valuable part of a nourishing prenatal diet. Packed with plant-based protein, essential nutrients, and free from lactose, soy milk serves as a supportive ally in your pregnancy journey.<br />
Just remember to consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice and opt for fortified, organic, unsweetened versions whenever possible.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Community is out there. And your child — just like Amelie — is more than their diagnosis.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="227" data-end="715">You never forget the moment your world shifts. For Benita, 43, that moment came quietly but decisively — not with a dramatic announcement, but during what was supposed to be a routine check-up at KK Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s Hospital. Her daughter Amelie, then just shy of three years old, had been admitted for a febrile seizure.</p>
<p data-start="227" data-end="715">But something else caught the doctor’s attention.</p>
<p data-start="227" data-end="715">When asked for her name, Amelie didn’t respond. She wasn’t engaging the way most children her age typically would.</p>
<p data-start="717" data-end="951">That small interaction sparked a journey that would forever change how Benita saw her daughter — and herself. After a referral to a Developmental and Behavioural Paediatrician, the confirmation came.</p>
<p data-start="717" data-end="951">Amelie was on the autism spectrum.</p>
<p data-start="953" data-end="1290">As a parent, you might find yourself grappling with the same storm of emotions. Denial. Guilt. Sleepless nights filled with questions. Benita did.</p>

<p data-start="953" data-end="1290"><em><strong>“I spent nights crying, questioning what had gone wrong — from my pregnancy to my parenting,”</strong></em> she recalls. <em><strong>“The diagnosis hit hard. There was guilt, fear, and deep uncertainty.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="1297" data-end="1348"> </p>
<strong data-start="1297" data-end="1348">Living With Autism is Not Less — Just Different</strong>

<p data-start="1350" data-end="1628">It’s okay to grieve the expectations you had. It’s okay to feel lost at first. But Benita wants you to know that a diagnosis of autism isn’t a life sentence. It’s a different roadmap. And it can be a gift. For her, receiving Amelie’s diagnosis brought not despair, but clarity.</p>

<p data-start="1630" data-end="2033"><em><strong>“It gave me permission to understand and accept her for who she truly is, rather than trying to fit her into neurotypical milestones,”</strong></em> she shares.</p>

<p data-start="1630" data-end="2033">That acceptance shifted everything. She stopped trying to correct behaviours like stimming or delayed responses. She began to build a parenting style that was structured yet loving, one that gave Amelie the predictability and clarity she needed to thrive.</p>
<p data-start="2035" data-end="2212">As a parent, you might feel like you&#8217;re drowning in unknowns. But as Benita’s story shows, the journey through autism can become one of empowerment, understanding, and even joy.</p>

<p><em><strong>&#8220;It took time to accept that Amelie was not “less,” but simply wired differently. &#8220;</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2219" data-end="2254"> </p>
<strong data-start="2219" data-end="2254">When Support Systems Fall Short</strong>
<p data-start="2256" data-end="2603">In Singapore, early intervention services do exist — but they’re often hard to access. After Amelie’s diagnosis, Benita was advised to enrol her in government-provided therapy. What she quickly discovered was how limited those sessions were.</p>

<p data-start="2256" data-end="2603"><em><strong>“Sometimes it was only once a quarter. It wasn’t enough,”</strong></em> she says. <em><strong>“We needed something more intensive.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2605" data-end="2993">So she did what many parents in her position do: she became a researcher, advocate, and warrior — all in one. Books, podcasts, online searches — she left no stone unturned.</p>
<p data-start="2605" data-end="2993">That’s how she found Bridging the Gap (BtG) in 2022. The multidisciplinary, integrated approach they offered was a breath of fresh air. For families looking for more than a piecemeal solution, BtG became a lifeline.</p>
</p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Source: BtG</p>

<p data-start="3000" data-end="3046"> </p>
<strong data-start="3000" data-end="3046">The Cost of Care</strong>
<p data-start="3048" data-end="3397">If you&#8217;re raising a child with autism, you know the financial strain is real. Therapy, assessments, specialist consultations — they all add up. For Benita’s family of six, surviving on one income, it wasn’t easy.</p>

<p data-start="3048" data-end="3397"><em><strong>“Budgeting for Amelie’s therapy was tough,”</strong></em> she says. But there was more than just the financial cost. There was the emotional one, too.</p>
<p data-start="3399" data-end="3650"><em><strong>“I had to educate myself from scratch on what autism really meant,”</strong></em> she shares. <em><strong>“There’s no manual. You’re constantly learning, adapting, and sometimes, failing.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="3399" data-end="3650">But she kept going — driven by love, by hope, and by the strength of her support system.</p>
<p data-start="3652" data-end="3839">Her husband, she says, has been her greatest pillar. Together, they’ve learned to lean on each other. And with BtG offering consistent, evidence-based care, they began to feel less alone.</p>
<p data-start="3846" data-end="3876"> </p>
<strong data-start="3846" data-end="3876">Small Wins, Big Milestones</strong>
<p data-start="3878" data-end="4174">Since starting at BtG, Amelie’s progress has been profound. She’s more focused, communicates more clearly, and is learning to navigate the world with increasing independence.</p>


<p data-start="3878" data-end="4174"><em><strong>“She can now balance on one foot, write with proper grip, and even wait safely to cross the road,”</strong></em> Benita shares proudly.</p>

<p data-start="4176" data-end="4386">These may seem like small milestones to others — but to a parent of a child with autism, they are everything. They are hard-won, deeply cherished, and proof that early, holistic intervention makes a difference.</p>
<p data-start="4393" data-end="4444"> </p>
<strong data-start="4393" data-end="4444">Autism and the Long Road to Emotional Endurance</strong>
<p data-start="4446" data-end="4661">As the years have passed, Benita has grown into her role as a caregiver with wisdom, patience, and emotional resilience. But the toll is real.</p>

<p data-start="4446" data-end="4661"><em><strong>“It’s been a journey of joy, worry, exhaustion, and growth,”</strong> </em>she admits.</p>

<p data-start="4663" data-end="4996">If you&#8217;re in the thick of it right now, know this: you’re not weak for feeling tired. You’re not failing for needing help. And you deserve a support system that holds you up when you can&#8217;t do it alone. For Benita, that includes her husband, her community, and centres like BtG that walk this road with families every step of the way.</p>
<p data-start="5003" data-end="5036"> </p>
<strong data-start="5003" data-end="5036">True Inclusion Starts With Us</strong>
<p data-start="5038" data-end="5301">Autism is not just a condition to be managed — it’s a way of seeing the world. And that world, Benita argues, needs to do better.</p>

<p data-start="5038" data-end="5301"><em><strong>“True inclusion means recognising that every child — regardless of ability — deserves to be seen, supported, and accepted,”</strong></em> she says.</p>

<p data-start="5303" data-end="5597">Buzzwords won’t change hearts. Actions will. Inclusion means training educators, redesigning public spaces, and most importantly, teaching our own children that different is not deficient.</p>
<p data-start="5303" data-end="5597">If Amelie is to thrive in Singapore, we all need to make space for her — and others like her — to belong.</p>
<p data-start="5604" data-end="5671"> </p>
<strong data-start="5604" data-end="5671">This Autistic Pride Day, Let’s Walk With Families Like Benita’s</strong>
</p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Source: Adobe Stock</p>

<p data-start="5673" data-end="5917">As Autistic Pride Day approaches on June 18, take a moment to reflect not just on the triumphs of the Autistic community, but also on the journey families like Benita’s have walked.</p>
<p data-start="5673" data-end="5917">Autism isn’t something to fear — it’s something to understand.</p>
<p data-start="5919" data-end="6196">If you’re a parent navigating this journey, know that you are not alone. Support is out there. Community is out there. And your child — just like Amelie — is more than their diagnosis. They are capable of growing, thriving, and teaching you a whole new way of seeing the world.</p>
<p data-start="6198" data-end="6281">Take a breath. Ask for help. Tell your story. And most importantly — keep going.</p>
<p data-start="6283" data-end="6428" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><em><strong>Need support? Reach out to ECDA-recognised centres like Bridging the Gap. Because your journey matters — and you don’t have to walk it alone.</strong></em></p>

<p>But she kept going — driven by love, by hope, and by the strength of her support system.<br />
Her husband, she says, has been her greatest pillar. Together, they’ve learned to lean on each other. And with BtG offering consistent, evidence-based care, they began to feel less alone.<br />
 <br />
Small Wins, Big Milestones<br />
Since starting at BtG, Amelie’s progress has been profound. She’s more focused, communicates more clearly, and is learning to navigate the world with increasing independence.</p>
<p>“She can now balance on one foot, write with proper grip, and even wait safely to cross the road,” Benita shares proudly.</p>
<p>These may seem like small milestones to others — but to a parent of a child with autism, they are everything. They are hard-won, deeply cherished, and proof that early, holistic intervention makes a difference.<br />
 <br />
Autism and the Long Road to Emotional Endurance<br />
As the years have passed, Benita has grown into her role as a caregiver with wisdom, patience, and emotional resilience. But the toll is real.</p>
<p>“It’s been a journey of joy, worry, exhaustion, and growth,” she admits.</p>
<p>If you're in the thick of it right now, know this: you’re not weak for feeling tired. You’re not failing for needing help. And you deserve a support system that holds you up when you can't do it alone. For Benita, that includes her husband, her community, and centres like BtG that walk this road with families every step of the way.<br />
 <br />
True Inclusion Starts With Us<br />
Autism is not just a condition to be managed — it’s a way of seeing the world. And that world, Benita argues, needs to do better.</p>
<p>“True inclusion means recognising that every child — regardless of ability — deserves to be seen, supported, and accepted,” she says.</p>
<p>Buzzwords won’t change hearts. Actions will. Inclusion means training educators, redesigning public spaces, and most importantly, teaching our own children that different is not deficient.<br />
If Amelie is to thrive in Singapore, we all need to make space for her — and others like her — to belong.<br />
 <br />
This Autistic Pride Day, Let’s Walk With Families Like Benita’s</p>
<p>As Autistic Pride Day approaches on June 18, take a moment to reflect not just on the triumphs of the Autistic community, but also on the journey families like Benita’s have walked.<br />
Autism isn’t something to fear — it’s something to understand.<br />
If you’re a parent navigating this journey, know that you are not alone. Support is out there. Community is out there. And your child — just like Amelie — is more than their diagnosis. They are capable of growing, thriving, and teaching you a whole new way of seeing the world.<br />
Take a breath. Ask for help. Tell your story. And most importantly — keep going.<br />
Need support? Reach out to ECDA-recognised centres like Bridging the Gap. Because your journey matters — and you don’t have to walk it alone.</p>

<p data-start="0" data-end="456" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Even though Singapore has one of the lowest maternal death rates in the world, <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/heart-disease-in-females-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cardiovascular disease</a> is still one of the top causes of maternal deaths. With more women choosing to have kids later in life, it’s becoming even more important to look after heart health during pregnancy. Dr. Kua Jieli, an Interventional Cardiologist at Carrington Cardiology and to: Dr Harvard Lin, Consultant Obstetrician, Gynaecologist and Urogynaecologist at the Asian Obstetric and Gynaecology Centre (AOGC) share expert tips on how to manage heart conditions during pregnancy and reduce long-term heart risks.</p>









<strong data-start="713" data-end="748">How Pregnancy Affects the Heart</strong>
<p data-start="750" data-end="1121">During pregnancy, a woman’s body goes through a lot of changes to support the baby — especially the heart and blood vessels.</p>
<p data-start="750" data-end="1121">According to Dr. Kua, &#8220;<em>Blood volume and the amount of blood the heart pumps go up by about 50%, while blood vessels relax and widen to help with flow, especially by the second trimester. The heart itself also changes; its size increases, and the main artery, the aorta, becomes more flexible.</em>&#8221; These changes are caused by pregnancy hormones like oestrogen, progesterone, and relaxin, which also help the placenta grow and make sure the baby gets enough blood and nutrients.</p>
<p data-start="1123" data-end="1311">For older mothers or women with pre-existing heart conditions, these changes can lead to complications like preeclampsia, stillbirth, early delivery, poor foetal growth, or heart problems during or after pregnancy, if not properly monitored.</p>
<strong data-start="1321" data-end="1378">Pregnancy Complications That Signal Future Heart Risk</strong>
<p data-start="1380" data-end="1534">Certain pregnancy complications serve as early indicators of heightened cardiovascular risk later in life. Dr. Kua identifies key conditions to watch for:</p>
<a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/preeclampsia-symptoms-treatments-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener" ><strong data-start="1540" data-end="1585">Preeclampsia</strong></a>
<p>This is when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and often protein in her urine. It’s linked to a 2 to 4 times higher risk of getting high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or heart failure in the future.</p>
<strong data-start="1540" data-end="1585">Gestational Hypertension</strong>
<p data-start="415" data-end="684"><a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/gestational-hypertension-symptoms-causes-impacts-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Gestational hypertension</a> means high blood pressure that starts during pregnancy, but without protein in the urine. It may go away after delivery, but it can be an early sign that the woman might develop long-term high blood pressure or heart disease later on.</p>
<strong data-start="1789" data-end="1813">Gestational Diabetes</strong>
<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gestational-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355339" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Gestational diabetes</a> shows up during pregnancy but usually goes away afterwards. However, it raises the risk of getting type 2 diabetes, metabolic issues, and coronary artery disease down the road.</p>
<a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/iugr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" ><strong data-start="2012" data-end="2072">Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR)</strong></a>
<p data-start="2074" data-end="2204">This is when the baby grows too slowly in the womb. It may point to issues with the mother’s blood flow or placenta, and could be a sign of deeper heart or blood vessel problems.</p>
<strong data-start="2210" data-end="2224">Pre-Term Birth</strong>
<p>Giving birth too early can be linked to inflammation and blood vessel problems, which increase the mum’s long-term risk of heart disease.</p>
<strong data-start="2210" data-end="2224">Stillbirth </strong>
<p data-start="2226" data-end="2348">Women who experience stillbirth have a higher long-term risk of heart disease, including stroke and myocardial infarction.</p>
<p data-start="2350" data-end="2498">“These complications may act as a &#8216;stress test&#8217; that reveals hidden problems with blood vessels or metabolism,” Dr. Kua emphasises.</p>
<strong data-start="2508" data-end="2577">Recognising Early Signs of Cardiovascular Issues During Pregnancy</strong>
<p data-start="2579" data-end="2716">Many early heart disease symptoms mirror typical pregnancy complaints and are often dismissed. Dr. Kua advises paying close attention to:</p>


<p data-start="2720" data-end="2750">Chest pain</p>


<p data-start="2753" data-end="2787">Fatigue</p>


<p data-start="2753" data-end="2787">Light-headedness</p>


<p data-start="2790" data-end="2817">Tachycardia rapid heart rate (&gt;100 bpm)</p>


<p data-start="2820" data-end="2859"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hearher/maternal-warning-signs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Shortness of breath</a>, especially at rest</p>

Persistent cough

<p data-start="2862" data-end="2883">Swelling in the limbs</p>


<p data-start="2886" data-end="2914">Frequent nighttime urination</p>


<p data-start="2916" data-end="3074">“Symptoms can appear during pregnancy or up to a year postpartum. If persistent, they may indicate a life-threatening cardiovascular condition,” he cautions.</p>
<strong data-start="197" data-end="245">How Can Pregnant Women Manage Heart Disease?</strong>
<p data-start="247" data-end="603"><a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/heart-truth/listen-to-your-heart/heart-health-and-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Managing heart conditions during pregnancy</a> requires a combination of proactive planning, vigilant monitoring, and a team-based medical approach. According to Dr. Kua Jieli, “<em data-start="421" data-end="602">Managing heart problems during pregnancy involves careful planning, close monitoring, and a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to ensure the safety of both mother and baby.</em>”</p>
<p data-start="605" data-end="953">For women with pre-existing cardiac conditions, preconception counselling is crucial. Risk assessments using tools such as the WHO maternal cardiovascular classification can guide treatment plans. Dr. Kua emphasises that medications like ACE inhibitors, statins, and warfarin should be substituted with pregnancy-safe alternatives before conception.</p>
<p data-start="955" data-end="1310">Throughout pregnancy, routine tests such as echocardiograms and ECGs help monitor heart function. Physicians closely observe symptoms like palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling, which may signal deterioration. Safe medications may include beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics for fluid control, and aspirin for preeclampsia risk reduction.</p>
<p data-start="1312" data-end="1713">Dr. Kua notes, “<em data-start="1328" data-end="1469">Delivery planning must be individualized, although vaginal delivery is typically preferred unless contraindicated by cardiovascular status.</em>” High-risk deliveries should occur in tertiary centres with cardiac support. Postpartum, the first six weeks are particularly critical, especially for patients with conditions like peripartum cardiomyopathy, necessitating continued monitoring.</p>
<strong data-start="3084" data-end="3143">Why is </strong><strong data-start="3084" data-end="3143">Postpartum Cardiovascular Screening </strong><strong data-start="3084" data-end="3143">Essential?</strong>
<p data-start="3145" data-end="3418">Despite the clear link between pregnancy complications and future cardiovascular disease (CVD), many postpartum programs omit heart health screening. Dr. Kua stresses that women with prior complications or existing heart disease must undergo routine assessments postpartum.</p>
<p data-start="3420" data-end="3583">“A multidisciplinary care approach—starting from delivery and extending up to a year postpartum—can identify risks early and improve long-term outcomes,” he adds.</p>
<strong data-start="3593" data-end="3651">Common Myths About Pregnancy and Heart Health—Debunked</strong>
<p data-start="3653" data-end="3735">Misinformation can put maternal health at risk. Dr. Kua addresses <a href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/debunking-common-pregnancy-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >prevalent myths</a>:</p>


<p data-start="3739" data-end="3856"><strong data-start="3739" data-end="3757">&#8220;Pregnancy is a time to enjoy eating for two people.&#8221; </strong>While it&#8217;s true that pregnant women need more nutrition, it should never be to the point that they&#8217;re meeting the caloric needs for two people. Excessive weight gain can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. A balanced diet is key. Plan to <em>gain </em><em>only 2.3kg in the first half of pregnancy and 0.5kg per week thereafter</em>. </p>


<p data-start="3859" data-end="3937"><strong data-start="3859" data-end="3883">&#8220;Eating spicy foods while pregnant can cause birth defects or harm the baby.&#8221;</strong> There is no evidence to suggest spicy foods can harm a developing foetus. But it may worsen heartburn, which can already be a problem during pregnancy.</p>


<p data-start="3940" data-end="4053"><strong data-start="3940" data-end="3971">&#8220;It is harmful to the baby when women sleep on their back.&#8221;</strong> There’s no need to panic if a pregnant woman ends up sleeping on her back — but there’s a bit of truth behind the concern. As the baby bump gets bigger, it can press down on a big vein called the inferior vena cava, which brings blood back to the heart. When this vein gets squashed, less blood flows back to the heart and around the body, including to the womb. This might make some women feel dizzy, sweaty, or even a bit nauseous.</p>


<p data-start="4056" data-end="4199"><strong data-start="4056" data-end="4092">&#8220;Keeping a pregnant woman’s heart rate lower than 140 bpm.&#8221;</strong> This outdated advice is no longer supported. Regular exercise won’t increase the risk of miscarriage, early delivery, or having a low birth weight baby. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services actually recommends that pregnant women aim for about <a href="https://eastdenver.coloradowomenshealth.com/blog/pregnancy-myths" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >150 minutes of moderate to intense exercise each week</a> — and there’s no need to worry about sticking to a strict heart rate limit. However, it’s still important not to push yourself too hard.</p>


 





<strong data-start="1723" data-end="1798">What Are Preventive Measures to Avoid Heart Issues in Pregnant Women?</strong>
<p data-start="1800" data-end="2075">Preventive care is fundamental to reducing cardiovascular complications during pregnancy. A heart-healthy lifestyle—balanced nutrition, regular light-to-moderate exercise, and avoiding harmful substances like tobacco and alcohol—lays the groundwork for maternal well-being.</p>
<p data-start="2077" data-end="2410">In addition to lifestyle, managing existing risk factors is essential. Conditions such as hypertension and diabetes must be controlled before and during pregnancy to prevent complications. Routine prenatal care allows early detection of warning signs, such as elevated blood pressure, which may indicate conditions like preeclampsia.</p>
<p data-start="2412" data-end="2701">Education plays a pivotal role in prevention. Dr. Kua advises that women should seek immediate medical attention for “<em data-start="2530" data-end="2645">chest pain, severe breathlessness (especially at rest), rapid weight gain, palpitations, or episodes of fainting,</em>” as these may indicate serious cardiovascular problems.</p>
<p data-start="2703" data-end="2862">By empowering women with knowledge and ensuring timely medical intervention, many pregnancy-related heart complications can be mitigated or avoided altogether.</p>
<strong data-start="4209" data-end="4277">How Cardiologists and OB-GYNs Can Work Together</strong>
<p data-start="54" data-end="235">&#8220;Cardiologists and OB-GYNs can enhance maternal care by fostering a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach that begins before conception and extends well into the postpartum period.&#8221;</p>
<p data-start="237" data-end="438">Starting with preconception counselling, It should include cardiovascular risk assessment, especially for those who are older, have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a history of heart problems</p>
<p data-start="440" data-end="838">During pregnancy, doctors from different specialities can come together to create a joint care plan for women with heart issues, whether pre-existing or newly diagnosed. Regular updates between the teams help make sure treatments are adjusted when needed. For high-risk pregnancies, a team that includes maternal-foetal medicine specialists, cardiologists, and anaesthesiologists can work together to ensure safer delivery.</p>
<p data-start="840" data-end="1183" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">After giving birth, it’s still important to monitor heart health, as some conditions, like pregnancy-related heart conditions like peripartum cardiomyopathy or hypertension, can continue or even show up for the first time postpartum. Using shared health records, integrated care pathways, and joint clinics can help ensure mums get smooth, coordinated care at every stage.</p>
<strong data-start="4711" data-end="4778">Improving Healthcare Systems for Better Postpartum Heart Health</strong>
<p>&#8220;<em>Healthcare systems can enhance cardiovascular follow-up for postpartum women by </em><em>emphasising the importance of a multidisciplinary, team-based approach to postpartum cardiovascular care</em>.&#8221; Dr. Kua said.</p>
<p>This means cardiologists, OB-GYNs, maternal-foetal medicine specialists, and family doctors should all work closely together to make sure mums get smooth, continuous care from delivery to long-term heart management.</p>
<p data-start="423" data-end="822">To prevent women with pregnancy-related heart risks from falling through the cracks, hospitals and clinics should set up structured referral systems and personalised follow-up plans. This includes identifying women who are more likely to face heart disease later and helping them manage things like high blood pressure, weight, cholesterol, and stress — especially in the first year after giving birth.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals can also help by:</p>


<p data-start="852" data-end="932">Doing standard heart health checks before discharge and during follow-up visits.</p>


<p data-start="935" data-end="1028">Using telehealth (video or phone consults) to make it easier for mums to attend appointments.</p>


<p data-start="1031" data-end="1151">Using digital tools, like health apps or reminders, to stay connected with new mums and keep them engaged in their care.</p>


<p data-start="1153" data-end="1291" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">All these steps can help make sure that mothers get the heart care they need — not just during pregnancy, but well after the baby is born.</p>

<p>How Pregnancy Affects the Heart<br />
During pregnancy, a woman’s body goes through a lot of changes to support the baby — especially the heart and blood vessels.<br />
According to Dr. Kua, "Blood volume and the amount of blood the heart pumps go up by about 50%, while blood vessels relax and widen to help with flow, especially by the second trimester. The heart itself also changes; its size increases, and the main artery, the aorta, becomes more flexible." These changes are caused by pregnancy hormones like oestrogen, progesterone, and relaxin, which also help the placenta grow and make sure the baby gets enough blood and nutrients.<br />

This is when the baby grows too slowly in the womb. It may point to issues with the mother’s blood flow or placenta, and could be a sign of deeper heart or blood vessel problems.<br />
Pre-Term Birth<br />
Giving birth too early can be linked to inflammation and blood vessel problems, which increase the mum’s long-term risk of heart disease.<br />
Stillbirth<br />
Women who experience stillbirth have a higher long-term risk of heart disease, including stroke and myocardial infarction.<br />
“These complications may act as a 'stress test' that reveals hidden problems with blood vessels or metabolism,” Dr. Kua emphasises.<br />
Recognising Early Signs of Cardiovascular Issues During Pregnancy<br />
Many early heart disease symptoms mirror typical pregnancy complaints and are often dismissed. Dr. Kua advises paying close attention to:</p>
<p>Chest pain</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Light-headedness</p>
<p>Tachycardia rapid heart rate (&gt;100 bpm)</p>
<p>Shortness of breath, especially at rest</p>
<p>	Persistent cough</p>
<p>Swelling in the limbs</p>
<p>Frequent nighttime urination</p>
<p>“Symptoms can appear during pregnancy or up to a year postpartum. If persistent, they may indicate a life-threatening cardiovascular condition,” he cautions.<br />
How Can Pregnant Women Manage Heart Disease?<br />
Managing heart conditions during pregnancy requires a combination of proactive planning, vigilant monitoring, and a team-based medical approach. According to Dr. Kua Jieli, “Managing heart problems during pregnancy involves careful planning, close monitoring, and a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to ensure the safety of both mother and baby.”<br />
For women with pre-existing cardiac conditions, preconception counselling is crucial. Risk assessments using tools such as the WHO maternal cardiovascular classification can guide treatment plans. Dr. Kua emphasises that medications like ACE inhibitors, statins, and warfarin should be substituted with pregnancy-safe alternatives before conception.<br />
Throughout pregnancy, routine tests such as echocardiograms and ECGs help monitor heart function. Physicians closely observe symptoms like palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling, which may signal deterioration. Safe medications may include beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics for fluid control, and aspirin for preeclampsia risk reduction.<br />
Dr. Kua notes, “Delivery planning must be individualized, although vaginal delivery is typically preferred unless contraindicated by cardiovascular status.” High-risk deliveries should occur in tertiary centres with cardiac support. Postpartum, the first six weeks are particularly critical, especially for patients with conditions like peripartum cardiomyopathy, necessitating continued monitoring.<br />
Why is Postpartum Cardiovascular Screening Essential?<br />
Despite the clear link between pregnancy complications and future cardiovascular disease (CVD), many postpartum programs omit heart health screening. Dr. Kua stresses that women with prior complications or existing heart disease must undergo routine assessments postpartum.<br />
“A multidisciplinary care approach—starting from delivery and extending up to a year postpartum—can identify risks early and improve long-term outcomes,” he adds.<br />
Common Myths About Pregnancy and Heart Health—Debunked<br />
Misinformation can put maternal health at risk. Dr. Kua addresses prevalent myths:</p>
<p>"Pregnancy is a time to enjoy eating for two people." While it's true that pregnant women need more nutrition, it should never be to the point that they're meeting the caloric needs for two people. Excessive weight gain can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. A balanced diet is key. Plan to gain only 2.3kg in the first half of pregnancy and 0.5kg per week thereafter. </p>
<p>"Eating spicy foods while pregnant can cause birth defects or harm the baby." There is no evidence to suggest spicy foods can harm a developing foetus. But it may worsen heartburn, which can already be a problem during pregnancy.</p>
<p>"It is harmful to the baby when women sleep on their back." There’s no need to panic if a pregnant woman ends up sleeping on her back — but there’s a bit of truth behind the concern. As the baby bump gets bigger, it can press down on a big vein called the inferior vena cava, which brings blood back to the heart. When this vein gets squashed, less blood flows back to the heart and around the body, including to the womb. This might make some women feel dizzy, sweaty, or even a bit nauseous.</p>
<p>"Keeping a pregnant woman’s heart rate lower than 140 bpm." This outdated advice is no longer supported. Regular exercise won’t increase the risk of miscarriage, early delivery, or having a low birth weight baby. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services actually recommends that pregnant women aim for about 150 minutes of moderate to intense exercise each week — and there’s no need to worry about sticking to a strict heart rate limit. However, it’s still important not to push yourself too hard.</p>
<p>What Are Preventive Measures to Avoid Heart Issues in Pregnant Women?<br />
Preventive care is fundamental to reducing cardiovascular complications during pregnancy. A heart-healthy lifestyle—balanced nutrition, regular light-to-moderate exercise, and avoiding harmful substances like tobacco and alcohol—lays the groundwork for maternal well-being.<br />
In addition to lifestyle, managing existing risk factors is essential. Conditions such as hypertension and diabetes must be controlled before and during pregnancy to prevent complications. Routine prenatal care allows early detection of warning signs, such as elevated blood pressure, which may indicate conditions like preeclampsia.<br />
Education plays a pivotal role in prevention. Dr. Kua advises that women should seek immediate medical attention for “chest pain, severe breathlessness (especially at rest), rapid weight gain, palpitations, or episodes of fainting,” as these may indicate serious cardiovascular problems.<br />
By empowering women with knowledge and ensuring timely medical intervention, many pregnancy-related heart complications can be mitigated or avoided altogether.<br />
How Cardiologists and OB-GYNs Can Work Together<br />
"Cardiologists and OB-GYNs can enhance maternal care by fostering a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach that begins before conception and extends well into the postpartum period."<br />
Starting with preconception counselling, It should include cardiovascular risk assessment, especially for those who are older, have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a history of heart problems<br />
During pregnancy, doctors from different specialities can come together to create a joint care plan for women with heart issues, whether pre-existing or newly diagnosed. Regular updates between the teams help make sure treatments are adjusted when needed. For high-risk pregnancies, a team that includes maternal-foetal medicine specialists, cardiologists, and anaesthesiologists can work together to ensure safer delivery.<br />
After giving birth, it’s still important to monitor heart health, as some conditions, like pregnancy-related heart conditions like peripartum cardiomyopathy or hypertension, can continue or even show up for the first time postpartum. Using shared health records, integrated care pathways, and joint clinics can help ensure mums get smooth, coordinated care at every stage.<br />
Improving Healthcare Systems for Better Postpartum Heart Health<br />
"Healthcare systems can enhance cardiovascular follow-up for postpartum women by emphasising the importance of a multidisciplinary, team-based approach to postpartum cardiovascular care." Dr. Kua said.<br />
This means cardiologists, OB-GYNs, maternal-foetal medicine specialists, and family doctors should all work closely together to make sure mums get smooth, continuous care from delivery to long-term heart management.<br />
To prevent women with pregnancy-related heart risks from falling through the cracks, hospitals and clinics should set up structured referral systems and personalised follow-up plans. This includes identifying women who are more likely to face heart disease later and helping them manage things like high blood pressure, weight, cholesterol, and stress — especially in the first year after giving birth.<br />
Healthcare professionals can also help by:</p>
<p>Doing standard heart health checks before discharge and during follow-up visits.</p>
<p>Using telehealth (video or phone consults) to make it easier for mums to attend appointments.</p>
<p>Using digital tools, like health apps or reminders, to stay connected with new mums and keep them engaged in their care.</p>
<p>All these steps can help make sure that mothers get the heart care they need — not just during pregnancy, but well after the baby is born.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What started as a simple act of support soon turned into something much bigger.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="159" data-end="418">You’re probably familiar with <a href="https://hairforhope.org.sg/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hair for Hope</a> — the iconic annual campaign that sees brave souls across Singapore shaving their heads in solidarity with children battling cancer.</p>
<p data-start="159" data-end="418">But have you ever wondered what keeps some people coming back year after year?</p>
<p data-start="420" data-end="753">Meet Jason Ong. He’s a father of two, a consulting manager in the telecom industry, and one of Hair for Hope’s longest-running ambassadors. For 13 years, Jason has shaved, shared, rallied, and repeated — turning a single act of compassion into a lifelong mission to support families facing one of the toughest battles imaginable.</p>
<p data-start="755" data-end="1046">As Singapore celebrates its 60th birthday, the Children’s Cancer Foundation is spotlighting powerful human-interest stories to kick off Hair for Hope 2025.</p>
<p data-start="755" data-end="1046">And Jason’s journey is one worth hearing — not just for the legacy he’s built, but for the community he’s inspired along the way.</p>
<p data-start="755" data-end="1046"> </p>
The First Shave and the Unexpected Chain Reaction
<p data-start="1110" data-end="1307">Jason first picked up the clippers back in 2008. What started as a simple act of support soon turned into something much bigger. Not only did he keep coming back to shave, but he also began organizing satellite events to grow the movement.</p>

<p data-start="1110" data-end="1307"><em><strong>“When I first shaved, my kids were still very young. I don’t think they really understood what was going on,”</strong></em> he recalls.</p>

<p data-start="1309" data-end="1546">But over time, the ritual became a teaching moment — a way to pass on values like empathy, resilience, and purpose. You know how it’s usually the organizers who chase people down? In Jason’s case, it was the opposite. His fellow “shavees” (yes, that’s a word) would beat him to the punch—emailing him months in advance to ask when the next satellite event was happening.</p>
<p data-start="1309" data-end="1546">That’s when he knew: this wasn’t just a one-off effort. It had become a community.</p>

<p data-start="1309" data-end="1546"><em><strong>“Each year when I shaved, I explained to them why I was doing it — to support children with cancer and their families.”</strong></em></p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969132" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Hair for Hope</p>


<p data-start="1548" data-end="1777">In 2010, when Jason organised his first Hair for Hope satellite event, he tried to get his son and daughter — then 10 and 8 years old — to join him on stage.</p>

<p data-start="1548" data-end="1777"><em><strong>“I kept pressing them to shave, but they kept refusing,”</strong></em> he laughs.</p>

<p data-start="1779" data-end="1818">Until one day, his son surprised him.</p>

<p data-start="1820" data-end="2033"><em><strong>“Just before the event, he told me he wanted to shave. I asked him why he changed his mind, and he said a classmate had cancer — he wanted to support him. I was really touched. It meant the message had sunk in.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2035" data-end="2426">That same day, Jason’s daughter joined her brother in solidarity.</p>

<p data-start="2035" data-end="2426"><em><strong>“Both of them shaved at the first satellite event. My son continued into his secondary school years, and my daughter shaved again when she was 12 and 16. They’ve stopped shaving for now — they’re quite attached to their hair — but they still help out at events, ushering and setting up. They’re still part of the movement.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2035" data-end="2426">Even as the kids grew older and stopped shaving their heads, they never stopped showing up. These days, they’re right there beside him at the events, helping with logistics—ushering guests, setting up stations, and quietly making things run smoothly behind the scenes.</p>
<p data-start="2035" data-end="2426"> </p>
What Keeps Jason Coming Back?
<p data-start="2948" data-end="3185">Motivation is a funny thing. You’d think after 13 years, the enthusiasm might fade. But for Jason, it’s only grown. When people around you believe in a cause so deeply that they nudge <em data-start="3132" data-end="3137">you</em> about the next event, that’s something special.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969127" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Hair for Hope</p>

<p data-start="3187" data-end="3412">He’s seen the campaign evolve, watched his shavees return year after year, and built bonds with strangers who eventually became friends. That kind of community doesn’t just happen—it takes someone like Jason to make it stick.</p>
<p data-start="3414" data-end="3771">And if you&#8217;re wondering what it&#8217;s like to shave your head for the first time, Jason gets the hesitation. Will the hair grow back the same? Will I look weird bald? Valid concerns. But as he likes to say, it’s worth doing at least once—if not for the look, then for the lesson.</p>
<p data-start="3414" data-end="3771">More importantly, you’re showing children battling cancer that they’re not alone.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969128" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Hair for Hope</p>

<p data-start="3414" data-end="3771"> </p>
Busting the Bald Myths
<p data-start="3806" data-end="3935">Let’s address the elephant in the room. Yes, shaving your head is a bold move. And no, it’s not a “get out of shampoo free” card.</p>

<p data-start="3402" data-end="3551"><em><strong>“I know many people want to support, but they’re afraid,”</strong></em> he says. <em><strong>“Some worry their hair won’t grow back. Others worry they won’t look good bald.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="3553" data-end="3593">His advice? Give it a try — just once.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969131" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Hair for Hope</p>

<p data-start="3937" data-end="4247">Jason laughs about how people often assume shaving means less effort. But in reality, scalp care is still a thing—especially in sunny Singapore. Even with a smooth head, you’ll need proper washing, sunscreen, and yes, shampoo.</p>
<p data-start="3937" data-end="4247">The key message? Don’t let vanity or myths hold you back from doing something good.</p>
<p data-start="3937" data-end="4247"> </p>
Together, We Can&#8230; And Should
<p data-start="4047" data-end="4152">This year’s theme for Hair for Hope is “Together, We Can” — and it perfectly sums up Jason’s journey.</p>
<p data-start="4154" data-end="4341">Through his efforts, Jason has not only supported children with cancer — he’s rallied a community, instilled lifelong values in his kids, and shown what it means to be an everyday hero.</p>

<p data-start="4343" data-end="4624"><em><strong>“For anyone going through cancer, or who has a loved one battling it — you are not alone,”</strong></em> Jason says. <em><strong>“Your family is there for you. But beyond that, there’s a big community of people, like us, who are here to support you. We may not know you personally, but we stand with you.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="5434" data-end="5618">If Jason’s story moved you, maybe it’s time to take that leap yourself. Hair for Hope 2025 is more than just a campaign—it’s a national movement of solidarity, compassion, and courage.</p>
<p data-start="5620" data-end="5709">Don’t worry about the bald head. Worry about the kind of impact you want to leave behind.</p>
<p data-start="5711" data-end="5783">Because who knows? Maybe next year, it’ll be your story we’re sharing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Explore the causes, risk factors, complications, and management strategies of fetal macrosomia, a condition where a baby is significantly larger than average at birth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine preparing for the arrival of your baby, only to discover that your little one is expected to be significantly larger than average. This scenario is a reality for many expectant parents facing fetal macrosomia. It is a condition where a newborn weighs more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams), regardless of gestational age.</p>
<p>While a chubby baby might seem adorable, fetal macrosomia can lead to complications for both mother and child during delivery and beyond.</p>

This scenario is a reality for many expectant parents facing fetal macrosomia. It is a condition where a newborn weighs more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams), regardless of gestational age.<br />
While a chubby baby might seem adorable, fetal macrosomia can lead to complications for both mother and child during delivery and beyond.<br />
Understanding the causes, risks, and management strategies is crucial for ensuring the health and safety of both.</p>
<p>What Is Fetal Macrosomia?<br />
Fetal macrosomia refers to a condition where a baby is born with a weight exceeding 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams). In some definitions, a weight over 9 pounds, 15 ounces (4,500 grams) is considered macrosomic.<br />
This condition is distinct from "large for gestational age" (LGA), which considers the baby's weight relative to the gestational age.<br />
 <br />
Causes and Risk Factors</p>
<p>Maternal Factors:</p>
<p>Diabetes: Both pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes can lead to increased fetal growth due to higher glucose levels.</p>
<p>Obesity: Excessive maternal weight before or during pregnancy can increase the risk.</p>
<p>Excessive Weight Gain: Gaining more weight than recommended during pregnancy can contribute to fetal macrosomia.</p>
<p>Previous Macrosomic Baby: Having delivered a large baby in the past increases the likelihood in subsequent pregnancies.</p>
<p>Post-term Pregnancy: Pregnancies extending beyond 40 weeks can result in larger babies.</p>
<p>Fetal Factors:</p>
<p>Genetics: Family history can play a role in determining baby's size.</p>
<p>Male Sex: Male babies are statistically more likely to be larger at birth.</p>
<p>Certain Medical Conditions: Conditions like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome can lead to increased fetal growth.</p>
<p>Signs and Diagnosis<br />
Diagnosing fetal macrosomia before birth can be challenging. Healthcare providers may use the following methods:</p>
<p>Ultrasound: Estimating fetal weight by measuring parts of the baby's body.</p>
<p>Fundal Height Measurement: Measuring the distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus.</p>
<p>Physical Examination: Assessing the size and position of the baby through palpation.</p>
<p>It's important to note that these methods are not always accurate, and the true weight of the baby is often only known after birth.<br />
 <br />
Potential Complications<br />
For the Mother:</p>
<p>Prolonged Labor: A larger baby can lead to longer labor durations.</p>
<p>Cesarean Delivery: Increased likelihood of requiring a C-section.</p>
<p>Birth Canal Injuries: Higher risk of perineal tears and postpartum hemorrhage.</p>
<p>For the Baby:</p>
<p>Shoulder Dystocia: Difficulty delivering the baby's shoulders after the head has emerged.</p>
<p>Birth Injuries: Risk of fractures or nerve damage during delivery.</p>
<p>Low Blood Sugar: Hypoglycemia shortly after birth.</p>
<p>Childhood Obesity: Higher risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome later in life.</p>
<p>Management and Treatment Options</p>
<p>Prenatal Management:</p>
<p>Monitoring: Regular ultrasounds to track fetal growth.</p>
<p>Blood Sugar Control: Managing maternal glucose levels through diet, exercise, or medication.</p>
<p>Weight Management: Ensuring appropriate weight gain during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Delivery Planning:</p>
<p>Mode of Delivery: Deciding between vaginal birth and cesarean delivery based on estimated fetal weight and maternal health.</p>
<p>Timing: Considering early induction if the baby is growing rapidly.</p>
<p>Postnatal Care:</p>
<p>Monitoring Baby's Health: Checking for hypoglycemia and other complications.</p>
<p>Maternal Recovery: Addressing any birth injuries or complications experienced by the mother.</p>
<p>Prevention Strategies</p>
<p>Preconception Counseling: Managing chronic conditions like diabetes before pregnancy.</p>

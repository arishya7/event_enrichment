										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Father’s Day is just around the corner. While we’re all tempted to reach for the same old “#1 Dad” mug or steakhouse reservation, maybe this is the year to pause and ask a deeper question: <em><strong>What does it really mean to be a dad in 2025?</strong></em></p>
<p>For Jeremy Chua, 35, a father of four, it means more than bringing home the bacon. It means showing up in the delivery room, attending parenting workshops, learning about latch techniques, and yes—even logging diaper changes.</p>
<p>Full-time, Jeremy leads a team of financial consultants. On the side, he co-facilitates prenatal classes at 13Thirteen alongside his wife, Rynette, also 35.</p>
<p>Together, they’re not just raising kids. They’re raising the bar for what modern parenting looks like in Singapore.</p>
 
<strong>From Young Parents to Parenting Educators</strong>
<p>Their story didn’t start in a delivery room, it started as a teenage dream. Jeremy had a vision at 15: four kids, a loving wife, a loud but happy home. Wild? Maybe. But also&#8230; kind of adorable. Married at 22, parents by 24, they knew early on that family would be central to their lives.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em><strong>“I always imagined having four kids,”</strong></em> Jeremy says. <em><strong>“Thankfully, Rynette shared that dream.”</strong></em></p>

<p>Now parents to three boys and one daughter, their experience of navigating young parenthood without much guidance inspired them to launch 13Thirteen, a platform dedicated to relatable, hands-on prenatal education that speaks to both mums and dads.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969484" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Jeremy Chua</p>


<p><strong>“We were young, you could say clueless, didn&#8217;t know what to expect,” </strong>Jeremy admits. <em><strong>“But that made us want to learn. And now, we’re here to pass that on.”</strong></em></p>

 
<strong>Parenting is a Partnership</strong>
</p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Source: 13Thirteen</p>

<p>Parenting isn’t a solo act. At 13Thirteen, the couple co-leads workshops where Jeremy shares from his lived experience as a hands-on father.</p>

<p><em><strong>“It’s not about being perfect,”</strong></em> he says. <em><strong>“It’s about being present.”</strong></em></p>

<p>In a space traditionally focused on mothers, 13Thirteen invites fathers to participate—not just as spectators, but as equals.</p>

<p><em><strong>“We run couple-led sessions so parents get both perspectives. Dads need to know they belong in the room, not just outside it.”</strong></em></p>
</p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Source: 13Thirteen</p>


<p>Their work is backed by real data: The <a href="https://family.org.sg/the-trials-and-triumphs-of-a-modern-day-father/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2024 Focus Singapore Fatherhood Survey</a> revealed that while most fathers (83.8%) are financially involved, only 26.4% feel emotionally connected to their parenting role.</p>
</p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Source: 13Thirteen</p>

<p>Jeremy sees this gap firsthand—and is working to close it.</p>
 
<strong>Yes, Dads Can (and Should) Support Breastfeeding</strong>
<p>If you think breastfeeding is just a mum’s job, Jeremy’s here to challenge that.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Dads need to know how they can support. Whether it’s understanding latch issues, helping with milk expression, or just being emotionally present—every bit counts.”</strong></em></p>

<p>He shares how issues like clogged milk ducts can snowball into painful problems if not properly addressed, and how <em>MyBBuddy</em>, an app created by Rynette and her team, is helping solve that.</p>

<strong>MyBBuddy: The Digital Parenting Tool Every New Parent Needs</strong>
<p>Already live on the App Store in Singapore, <em>MyBBuddy</em> is like a digital companion for the early parenting phase. With tools like a contraction timer, feeding tracker, symptom checker, and emotional check-ins, the app is designed to support both mums and dads.</p>
</p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Source: 13Thirteen</p>


<p><em><strong>“It’s especially helpful for parents who can’t afford constant consultations,”</strong></em> Jeremy explains. <em><strong>“It provides instant, practical advice so problems don’t get worse.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="4102" data-end="4114">It includes:</p>


<p data-start="4117" data-end="4191"><strong data-start="4117" data-end="4144">Feeding and diaper logs</strong> (so dads can take the night shift like champs)</p>


<p data-start="4194" data-end="4247"><strong data-start="4194" data-end="4216">Contraction timers</strong> (no more panicking in the car)</p>


<p data-start="4250" data-end="4333"><strong data-start="4250" data-end="4285">Lactation troubleshooting tools</strong> (because Google is not your best friend at 3am)</p>


<p>While Rynette leads development, Jeremy proudly champions its purpose.</p>

<p><em><strong>“It’s about making support accessible and normalising shared responsibility.”</strong></em></p>

 
<strong>Life at Home</strong>
<p>With four kids, life is anything but quiet.</p>

<p><em><strong>“It’s a circus—but a joyful one,”</strong></em> Jeremy laughs. <em><strong>“We’ve had moments of doubt. After our third son, I wondered if we could really handle a fourth. But Rynette still hoped for a daughter—and we got her.”</strong></em></p>

<p>Despite their professional experience, the couple is quick to admit that parenting is still a daily learning curve.</p>

<p><em><strong>“We’re not superhuman. We struggle too. But we’re in it together.”</strong></em></p>

 
<strong>Fatherhood is a Daily Role, Not a One-Day Celebration</strong>
<p>Jeremy appreciates the sentiment behind Father’s Day, but he’s not waiting for a cake to feel validated.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969478" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Instagram/jemchua</p>


<p><em><strong>“To me, being a dad isn’t about that one day. It’s about what you do every day—waking up, helping out, being there.”</strong></em></p>

<p>Still, the occasion can be powerful when it sparks visibility and conversation. Last year, Jeremy and Rynette joined a record-setting baby-wearing walk for dads in Singapore.</p>

<p><em><strong>“It was symbolic. A community of fathers saying, ‘We’re here, and we’re proud to be involved.’”</strong></em></p>

 
<strong>Why Modern Dads Matter</strong>
<p>So what does Jeremy think defines a modern dad?</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969483" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Jeremy Chua</p>


<p><em><strong>“A modern dad participates. He doesn’t wait to be told. He learns. He listens. He changes diapers. He supports breastfeeding. He shows up to parent-teacher meetings. He grows with the family.”</strong></em></p>

<p>That’s the real shift—from provision to partnership. And it’s happening.</p>

<p><em><strong>“We see it in our workshops. Dads want to be there. They just need the right tools and the right encouragement.”</strong></em></p>

 
<strong>Jeremy’s Parenting Tips for New and Expecting Dads</strong>
<p>If you’re new to parenting—or about to be—here’s Jeremy’s simple but powerful advice:</p>


<p><strong>Get involved early</strong>: “Don’t wait until baby arrives. Be there from pregnancy.”</p>


<p><strong>Ask questions</strong>: “There’s no shame in not knowing. Learn with your partner.”</p>


<p><strong>Support your spouse emotionally</strong>: “Listen. Be patient. This journey is as much hers as it is yours.”</p>


<p><strong>Know that presence matters</strong>: “Your baby won’t remember what you bought. But they’ll remember how you made them feel.”</p>


 
<strong>The Parenting Future Singapore Deserves</strong>
<p>Jeremy is living proof that the modern Singaporean dad isn’t just a provider. He’s a partner. A night-feed warrior. A contraction coach. A man who fell in love with his wife all over again—while supporting her through labour, breastfeeding, and parenting four children.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="141">Because dads like him aren’t just backup, they’re co-pilots. Diaper duty? Handled. Emotional check-ins? Done. Prenatal class co-facilitator? Why not.</p>
<p data-start="143" data-end="311" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">So this Father’s Day, let’s retire the same old “#1 Dad” mug or steakhouse reservation. The real gift? Recognizing that the future of parenting isn’t just maternal — it’s mutual.</p>

<p data-start="582" data-end="930">When Hailey Bieber graced the cover of Vogue France earlier this year, the spotlight should’ve been on her. But it wasn’t—at least not for the right reasons. In a moment that went viral, her husband, Justin Bieber, reportedly made a sarcastic remark about the shoot, leading fans to speculate that he wasn&#8217;t entirely supportive of her solo success.</p>
<p data-start="932" data-end="1185">Fast forward just weeks later, and Hailey is the one making headlines again—but this time, it&#8217;s for something far bigger: her beauty brand Rhode is reportedly being acquired by ELF Beauty in a deal valued at US$1.1 billion (approximately S$1.5 billion).</p>
<p data-start="1187" data-end="1364">And just like that, Hailey didn’t need to defend herself. She didn’t post a Notes app message or clap back in an interview. She just let her billion-dollar brand do the talking.</p>
<p data-start="1366" data-end="1854">Hailey Bieber launched Rhode in 2022 with a clear vision: clean, minimalist skincare that worked. Despite early skepticism from critics who called it “just another celebrity beauty line,” Rhode quickly became a Gen Z favourite, selling out multiple times and gaining cult status for products like the Peptide Lip Treatment and Glazing Milk. Hailey herself remained the face and creative force behind the brand, ensuring her voice—soft-spoken but certain—carried through in every campaign.</p>
<p data-start="1856" data-end="2118">The ELF deal cements her not just as a founder, but a serious businesswoman. According to reports, Hailey will remain involved with the brand even after the acquisition, signalling that this isn’t a celebrity cash-out—it’s a strategic move to scale even further.</p>
<p data-start="2120" data-end="2492">What makes this moment resonate isn’t just the billion-dollar number—it’s the contrast. From being side-eyed on her own cover shoot to standing at the helm of one of the year’s biggest beauty acquisitions, Hailey’s rise is a reminder that silence can be strength, and building something of your own is the best response to being underestimated—even by people close to you.</p>
<p data-start="2494" data-end="2705">In a world that still often defines women by who they’re with, Hailey is showing the power of betting on yourself. And for every woman who’s ever been told she’s “just someone’s wife,” this story hits different.</p>
<p data-start="2707" data-end="2764">After all, success may not be loud—but it’s always heard.</p>

In a world that still often defines women by who they’re with, Hailey is showing the power of betting on yourself. And for every woman who’s ever been told she’s “just someone’s wife,” this story hits different.<br />
After all, success may not be loud—but it’s always heard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="285" data-end="519">On her 11th birthday, young Trixia Anne Arellano did something extraordinary—she broke a national record in the 200-metre dash at a major youth sports event in the Philippines. What made her win even more remarkable? She ran barefoot.</p>
<p data-start="521" data-end="857">Representing Western Visayas in the Philippines&#8217; 65th Palarong Pambansa (a national student-athlete competition similar to Singapore&#8217;s National School Games), Trixia finished the 200-metre race in just 26.40 seconds—surpassing a 17-year-old record. The next day, she added another gold medal to her name by winning the 100-metre sprint.</p>
<p data-start="859" data-end="1168">But beyond the medals and broken records, it was how she won that captured hearts across the region. Trixia had worn shoes in the preliminary rounds and didn’t win. But during the finals, she made the bold decision to go barefoot—something she felt more comfortable with, and the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p data-start="1170" data-end="1572">Her story is a powerful reminder to parents everywhere that sometimes, the best thing we can do is support our children in finding their own stride—literally and figuratively. Whether it’s allowing them to try something unconventional, or backing their decisions that may seem unusual at first glance, Trixia’s triumph shows us that confidence, self-awareness, and heart can make a world of difference.</p>
<p data-start="1574" data-end="1868">As Singaporean parents raising children in an increasingly competitive world, it’s easy to focus on results—be it academic scores or performance in co-curricular activities. But stories like Trixia’s remind us that resilience, self-belief, and the courage to be different are just as important.</p>
<p data-start="1870" data-end="2020">So the next time your child wants to try something their own way (within safe limits, of course), it might just be the beginning of a winning journey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you’re expecting, every bite and sip counts. While <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/milk-for-pregnancy" >cow’s milk</a> is a common staple in pregnancy diets, goat milk is gaining traction among health-conscious moms. Known for its easy digestibility and rich nutrient profile, many wonder: Is goat milk good for pregnancy?</p>
<p>This article dives deep into the facts, separating myth from reality and helping you make informed, bump-friendly choices.</p>

<strong data-start="918" data-end="974">Nutritional Benefits of Goat Milk During Pregnancy</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969395" class="wp-caption-text">Goat Milk During Pregnancy: Is It Safe and Nutritious?</p>

<strong data-start="980" data-end="1025">1. A Powerful Dose of Essential Nutrients</strong>
<p data-start="1027" data-end="1097">Goat milk is packed with key nutrients that support both mom and baby:</p>


<p data-start="1100" data-end="1159"><strong data-start="1100" data-end="1111">Calcium</strong> – Crucial for fetal bone and tooth development.</p>


<p data-start="1162" data-end="1229"><strong data-start="1162" data-end="1175">Vitamin A</strong> – Supports healthy skin, vision, and immune function.</p>


<p data-start="1232" data-end="1305"><strong data-start="1232" data-end="1259">Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)</strong> – Promotes energy production and cell growth.</p>


<p data-start="1308" data-end="1373"><strong data-start="1308" data-end="1319">Protein</strong> – Aids in the formation of baby’s organs and tissues.</p>


<strong data-start="1379" data-end="1416">2. Easier on the Digestive System</strong>
<p data-start="1418" data-end="1494">Many expectant moms find goat milk easier to digest than cow’s milk because:</p>


<p data-start="1497" data-end="1564">It contains smaller fat globules, leading to quicker digestion.</p>


<p data-start="1567" data-end="1767">It has less alpha-casein, a protein that some people find difficult to process.</p>


<p>This makes goat milk a possible solution for those with mild lactose sensitivities though it’s not lactose-free.</p>
<strong data-start="1773" data-end="1804">3. Boosts the Immune System</strong>
<p data-start="1806" data-end="1967">Goat milk naturally contains bioactive compounds like selenium and zinc that can help strengthen the immune system, which undergoes changes during pregnancy.</p>
<p data-start="1806" data-end="1967"> </p>
<strong data-start="1977" data-end="2011">Things to Be Cautious About</strong>
<strong data-start="2017" data-end="2056">1. Pasteurization is Non-Negotiable</strong>
<p data-start="2058" data-end="2205"><strong data-start="2058" data-end="2107">Never consume raw goat milk during pregnancy.</strong> It can contain dangerous bacteria like <em data-start="2147" data-end="2157">Listeria</em>, <em data-start="2159" data-end="2171">Salmonella</em>, or <em data-start="2176" data-end="2185">E. coli</em>, which can lead to:</p>


<p data-start="2208" data-end="2219">Miscarriage</p>


<p data-start="2222" data-end="2237">Premature labor</p>


<p data-start="2240" data-end="2328">Severe illness for both mother and baby<br data-start="2279" data-end="2282" /><br />
<strong data-start="2282" data-end="2328">Always opt for pasteurized goat milk only.</strong></p>


<strong data-start="2334" data-end="2364">2. Watch for Fortification</strong>
<p data-start="2366" data-end="2501">Unlike commercial cow’s milk, goat milk may <strong data-start="2410" data-end="2443">lack folic acid and vitamin D</strong> unless it’s fortified. These nutrients are essential for:</p>


<p data-start="2504" data-end="2552">Preventing birth defects (especially folic acid)</p>


<p data-start="2555" data-end="2694">Supporting calcium absorption and immune health (vitamin D)<br data-start="2614" data-end="2617" /><br />
Choose fortified versions or ensure your prenatal vitamins cover these needs.</p>


<strong data-start="2700" data-end="2724">3. Allergy Awareness</strong>
<p data-start="2726" data-end="2931">While goat milk proteins are different from cow milk, they can still trigger allergies. If you’ve had dairy sensitivities or allergies in the past, consult your doctor before adding goat milk to your diet.</p>
<p data-start="2726" data-end="2931"> </p>
<strong data-start="2941" data-end="2996">How Much Goat Milk Can You Drink While Pregnant?</strong>
<p data-start="2998" data-end="3142">Most health professionals recommend <strong data-start="3034" data-end="3058">1–2 servings per day</strong> (about one cup each) as part of a balanced prenatal diet. Goat milk can be used in:</p>


<p data-start="3145" data-end="3154">Smoothies</p>


<p data-start="3157" data-end="3174">Cereal or oatmeal</p>


<p data-start="3177" data-end="3194">Cooking or baking</p>


<p data-start="3197" data-end="3222">Homemade yogurt or cheese</p>



<strong data-start="3232" data-end="3273">Expert Tip: Speak With Your Doctor</strong>
<p data-start="3275" data-end="3514">Every pregnancy is unique. While goat milk can be highly nutritious, it’s essential to discuss dietary choices with your OB-GYN or dietitian, especially if you’re managing gestational diabetes, hypertension, or any digestive disorders.</p>
<p data-start="3275" data-end="3514"> </p>
<strong data-start="220" data-end="259">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</strong>
<strong data-start="265" data-end="316">1. Is goat milk safe to drink during pregnancy?</strong>

<strong data-start="1013" data-end="1071">4. Is goat milk better than cow milk during pregnancy?</strong>
<p data-start="1074" data-end="1279">Goat milk is easier to digest and may be less allergenic for some, but cow milk is often fortified with folic acid and vitamin D. The best choice depends on your nutritional needs and how your body reacts.</p>
<strong data-start="1285" data-end="1349">5. How much goat milk should a pregnant woman drink per day?</strong>
<p data-start="1352" data-end="1517">1–2 cups per day is generally safe, depending on your overall diet. It’s best to incorporate it as part of a balanced meal plan approved by your healthcare provider.</p>
<strong data-start="1523" data-end="1591">6. Should I drink goat milk instead of taking prenatal vitamins?</strong>
<p data-start="1594" data-end="1753">No. Goat milk can complement a healthy pregnancy diet but <strong data-start="1652" data-end="1692">should not replace prenatal vitamins</strong>, which provide essential nutrients like folic acid and iron.</p>
<strong data-start="1759" data-end="1831">7. Can I drink goat milk if I’m lactose intolerant during pregnancy?</strong>
<p data-start="1834" data-end="2010">Goat milk contains less lactose than cow’s milk but still contains some. If you&#8217;re lactose intolerant, speak to your doctor or try lactose-free or plant-based alternatives.</p>
<p data-start="1834" data-end="2010"> </p>
<strong data-start="3524" data-end="3589">Final Thoughts</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969396" class="wp-caption-text">Goat Milk During Pregnancy: Is It Safe and Nutritious?</p>

<p data-start="3591" data-end="4040">Goat milk can be a fantastic addition to your pregnancy diet if it’s pasteurized, fortified, and consumed in moderation. It delivers a rich array of nutrients, supports digestion, and can be a refreshing alternative to traditional dairy.</p>
<p data-start="3591" data-end="4040">However, make sure you’re mindful of potential allergies and nutrient gaps. With the right guidance, this creamy, gentle milk can nourish both you and your baby beautifully throughout your pregnancy journey.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite all his achievements — being a Cambridge examiner, teaching over 400 students, founding a centre — Kelvin says fatherhood remains his greatest and most humbling role.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="217" data-end="557">With Father’s Day just around the corner, there’s a lot of talk about what it means to be a father — the provider, the protector, the planner. But in real life, none of these roles come with a manual. And as Singaporean parents juggling careers, school stress, and growing kids, we know that sometimes it feels like we’re just winging it.</p>
<p data-start="559" data-end="656">Now imagine doing all that while teaching one of the most feared subjects in school: Chemistry.</p>
<p data-start="658" data-end="1133">Kelvin Ang, former MOE JC teacher, Cambridge examiner, and the founder of The Chemistry Practice, doesn’t just teach Chemistry. He lives the balancing act every father knows well: trying to be present at home while making a difference at work. He’s spent over a decade helping hundreds of students master one of the most complex subjects in the A-Level syllabus. But it wasn’t until he became a father himself that his approach to teaching — and life — truly transformed.</p>
<p data-start="1135" data-end="1378">This Father’s Day, Kelvin offers something a little different. Not a formula. Not a solution. But a reflection on what teaching Chemistry has taught him about being a father, and what being a father has taught him about teaching Chemistry.</p>
 
From Military Control Tower to Classroom (and Then Home)
<p data-start="1446" data-end="1797">Kelvin didn’t start out with a periodic table and whiteboard in hand. In fact, he spent six years as an Air Traffic Controller in the Air Force after national service.</p>

<p data-start="1446" data-end="1797"><em><strong>&#8220;At that point, I started asking myself — is this really what I want to do long-term? I realised maybe it was time to try something I had always wanted to do but never got around to — teaching.&#8221;</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="1446" data-end="1797">The other career tugging at him was teaching — something he had shelved but never truly let go of.</p>
<p data-start="1799" data-end="2042">So, he pivoted. He entered the MOE system, taught in Junior Colleges, and eventually worked at a leading Chemistry tuition centre. And while his students were achieving solid grades — many scoring As and Bs — something else was nagging at him.</p>

<p data-start="2044" data-end="2173"><em><strong>“By having my own centre, I have the freedom to design my own way of teaching — how I want to approach each topic, and what kinds of questions to go through in class. It’s something I’m really proud of, because it allows me to develop and customise everything myself.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2175" data-end="2383">And so in 2021, in the middle of raising two young kids with his wife of 14 years, he launched The Chemistry Practice — a space designed not just for academic achievement, but for deeper learning and support.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969381" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Kelvin Ang</p>

 
Teaching Chemistry, While Raising Humans
<p data-start="2435" data-end="2591">Ask any parent. Raising kids is an education in itself. But ask a father who’s also a teacher, and he’ll tell you just how intertwined the two really are.</p>

<p data-start="2435" data-end="2591"><em><strong>&#8220;When you&#8217;re handling your own kids, your expectations of them tend to be higher, I would say. I do get a little bit less patient with my kids.&#8221;</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="3665" data-end="3940"><em><strong>&#8220;So it is multifaceted, and then you also have organic chemistry, where you need to be able to draw the structures correctly. As a Chemistry teacher, you&#8217;re teaching them a lot of different techniques to solve questions — calculations, drawings, graphing,&#8221;</strong></em> Kelvin explains. <strong><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s really multifaceted; it&#8217;s not just calculation-based. This is what makes Chemistry difficult.&#8221;</em></strong></p>

<p data-start="3942" data-end="3958">Sounds familiar?</p>
<p data-start="3960" data-end="4150">Parenting, too, is a series of evolving challenges. What works at age 4 doesn’t work at 14. And when your child suddenly doesn’t “get” something in school — or life — it’s tempting to panic.</p>
<p data-start="4152" data-end="4197">But Kelvin has a calming counter-perspective.</p>

<p data-start="4199" data-end="4295"><em><strong>&#8220;So while academic achievements are important, they shouldn&#8217;t come at the expense of mental health,&#8221;</strong></em> he says. <em><strong>&#8220;It’s essential for schools, parents, and teachers to work together to find the right balance and to support both the academic goals as well as the mental and emotional health of our children.&#8221;</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="4297" data-end="4447">So he encourages both parents and students to be realistic — but proactive. Be present, ask better questions, and support with patience, not pressure.</p>
 
Real Support for Real Exams
<p data-start="5284" data-end="5429">Let’s get practical for a second. For A-Level Chemistry students, it’s not just about understanding — it’s about recalling tons of information.</p>
<p data-start="5431" data-end="5477">One tool Kelvin swears by? Digital flashcards.</p>

<p data-start="5479" data-end="5655"><em><strong>&#8220;For A-Level Chemistry, they have to remember close to 60 or more reactions,&#8221;</strong></em> he explains. <em><strong>&#8220;That’s where flashcards come in. They help students recall the reactions they must remember. I always tell them, on the way to school, just take 5 to 10 minutes to go through the flashcards. If you do it consistently every day, over time, you&#8217;ll be able to remember all the reactions.&#8221;</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="5657" data-end="5771">It’s a small, doable habit that teaches consistency — something every father hopes to instil in their children.</p>
<p data-start="5773" data-end="6015">He also focuses on exposing students to all levels of questions — easy to brutally difficult — so they don’t panic during the exam. In other words, life skills — disguised as Chemistry prep.</p>

But in real life, none of these roles come with a manual. And as Singaporean parents juggling careers, school stress, and growing kids, we know that sometimes it feels like we’re just winging it.<br />
Now imagine doing all that while teaching one of the most feared subjects in school: Chemistry.<br />
Kelvin Ang, former MOE JC teacher, Cambridge examiner, and the founder of The Chemistry Practice, doesn’t just teach Chemistry. He lives the balancing act every father knows well: trying to be present at home while making a difference at work. He’s spent over a decade helping hundreds of students master one of the most complex subjects in the A-Level syllabus. But it wasn’t until he became a father himself that his approach to teaching — and life — truly transformed.<br />
This Father’s Day, Kelvin offers something a little different. Not a formula. Not a solution. But a reflection on what teaching Chemistry has taught him about being a father, and what being a father has taught him about teaching Chemistry.<br />
 <br />
From Military Control Tower to Classroom (and Then Home)<br />
Kelvin didn’t start out with a periodic table and whiteboard in hand. In fact, he spent six years as an Air Traffic Controller in the Air Force after national service.</p>
<p>"At that point, I started asking myself — is this really what I want to do long-term? I realised maybe it was time to try something I had always wanted to do but never got around to — teaching."</p>
<p>The other career tugging at him was teaching — something he had shelved but never truly let go of.<br />
So, he pivoted. He entered the MOE system, taught in Junior Colleges, and eventually worked at a leading Chemistry tuition centre. And while his students were achieving solid grades — many scoring As and Bs — something else was nagging at him.</p>
<p>“By having my own centre, I have the freedom to design my own way of teaching — how I want to approach each topic, and what kinds of questions to go through in class. It’s something I’m really proud of, because it allows me to develop and customise everything myself.”</p>
<p>And so in 2021, in the middle of raising two young kids with his wife of 14 years, he launched The Chemistry Practice — a space designed not just for academic achievement, but for deeper learning and support.</p>
<p> <br />
Teaching Chemistry, While Raising Humans<br />
Ask any parent. Raising kids is an education in itself. But ask a father who’s also a teacher, and he’ll tell you just how intertwined the two really are.</p>
<p>"When you're handling your own kids, your expectations of them tend to be higher, I would say. I do get a little bit less patient with my kids."<br />
"Somehow, my wife always comments that I'm more patient with my students than with my own kids," Kelvin laughs.</p>
<p>It’s a moment many parents can relate to. We expect our own children to “know better” or to behave the way we hope they will. But the truth? Parenting — like Chemistry — is full of variables.</p>
<p>"But you learn the way to break down difficult concepts into easier, digestible small bites. So this actually helps me in explaining the difficult concepts to the older kids that I have in the tuition centre."</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Mental disorders in SG youth are now the leading cause of disability and death among ages 10–14, a new Lancet study reveals. Learn what’s driving the trend and how parents can help.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="266" data-end="403">As parents, we worry about grades, <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/3-6-9-12-method" >screen time</a>, sleep, and nutrition. But how often do we stop to check in on our child’s mental health?</p>
<p data-start="405" data-end="624">A new study published in <em data-start="430" data-end="456">The Lancet Public Health</em> has highlighted something every parent in Singapore needs to hear. Mental disorders are now the leading cause of disability and death among children aged 10 to 14.</p>
<p data-start="626" data-end="676">This isn’t just a statistic. It’s a wake-up call.</p>
<p data-start="626" data-end="676"> </p>
<strong>Alarming Statistics</strong>
<p>In 2021 alone, Singapore recorded approximately 653,000 diagnoses of mental disorders, with prevalence rates at 12.8% for males and 11.7% for females. Among the most commonly reported conditions were anxiety (affecting 185,000 individuals) and depression (144,000 individuals).</p>
<p>The impact is particularly severe among tweens. The 10–14 age group now faces mental illness as the primary contributor to both disability and mortality, a stark contrast to traditional concerns such as infectious diseases or physical injuries.</p>

<strong>Causes Behind the Crisis</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969350" class="wp-caption-text">Mental Disorders Now Leading Health Concern Among Singaporean Tweens, Study Finds</p>

<p>Experts point to several contributing factors:</p>


<p><strong>Academic Pressure and Social Media</strong>: High expectations in school and the 24/7 presence of social media have led to increased stress, performance anxiety, and low self-esteem among children and teens.</p>


<p><strong>Family and Social Changes</strong>: Rising rates of family breakdowns, social isolation, and Westernized societal shifts have also been linked to a growing mental health burden.</p>

But how often do we stop to check in on our child’s mental health?<br />
A new study published in The Lancet Public Health has highlighted something every parent in Singapore needs to hear. Mental disorders are now the leading cause of disability and death among children aged 10 to 14.<br />
This isn’t just a statistic. It’s a wake-up call.<br />
 <br />
Alarming Statistics<br />
In 2021 alone, Singapore recorded approximately 653,000 diagnoses of mental disorders, with prevalence rates at 12.8% for males and 11.7% for females. Among the most commonly reported conditions were anxiety (affecting 185,000 individuals) and depression (144,000 individuals).<br />
The impact is particularly severe among tweens. The 10–14 age group now faces mental illness as the primary contributor to both disability and mortality, a stark contrast to traditional concerns such as infectious diseases or physical injuries.</p>
<p>Causes Behind the Crisis</p>
<p>Experts point to several contributing factors:</p>
<p>Academic Pressure and Social Media: High expectations in school and the 24/7 presence of social media have led to increased stress, performance anxiety, and low self-esteem among children and teens.</p>
<p>Family and Social Changes: Rising rates of family breakdowns, social isolation, and Westernized societal shifts have also been linked to a growing mental health burden.</p>
<p>The Lingering Impact of COVID-19: The pandemic disrupted routines, isolated families, and created widespread uncertainty. This is particularly hard on young, developing minds.</p>
<p>"Clinically, mental health challenges often emerge early in life and, if unaddressed, can lead to years of lost potential," said Professor Alina Rodriguez from NUS Medicine, one of the collaborators on the paper.</p>

The study also found a threefold rise in mental disorders among those aged 70 and above compared to 1990. As people live longer, depression often follows declining physical health, making mental health an important issue across all life stages.<br />
 <br />

<p>Normalize seeking help — show your child that mental health care is just as important as physical health care.</p>
<p>Reach out to school counselors, family doctors, or mental health helplines.</p>

Developed by U.S.-based biotech company Contraline, this innovation presents a promising alternative to traditional male contraceptive methods like condoms and vasectomies.</p>
<strong data-start="472" data-end="490">How ADAM Works</strong>
<p data-start="492" data-end="642">The <a href="https://www.contraline.com/product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >ADAM implant</a> utilises a water-soluble hydrogel that is injected into the vas deferens—the ducts responsible for transporting sperm. This hydrogel acts as a physical barrier, preventing sperm from mixing with semen during ejaculation. Over time, the hydrogel is designed to naturally dissolve, potentially restoring fertility without the need for surgical intervention.</p>
<p>The implantation procedure is minimally invasive, taking less than 30 minutes and requiring only local anaesthesia. This approach offers a less permanent solution compared to vasectomy and avoids the daily maintenance associated with condoms.</p>
Is the ADAM Implant Safe?
<p data-start="1183" data-end="1462">Yes—early trial data suggests that ADAM is <strong data-start="1226" data-end="1253">safe and well-tolerated</strong>. In a Phase 1 clinical trial with 25 healthy male participants, no serious adverse effects were reported. In fact, the two men who reached the 24-month milestone showed <strong data-start="1423" data-end="1461">no detectable sperm in their semen</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1464" data-end="1644">The implant is also <strong data-start="1484" data-end="1498">reversible</strong>, with the hydrogel expected to dissolve naturally over time. Contraline is actively developing procedures for early removal and reversal as well.</p>
Still Under Critical Trials
<p data-start="1678" data-end="1958">While early results are promising, it’s important to note that <strong data-start="1741" data-end="1785">ADAM is still undergoing clinical trials</strong>. Regulatory approval has been granted for <strong data-start="1828" data-end="1859">Phase 2 trials in Australia</strong>, involving 30–50 participants to further assess the implant’s safety, efficacy, and reversibility.</p>
<p data-start="1960" data-end="2006">Kevin Eisenfrats, CEO of Contraline, shared:</p>
<p data-start="1960" data-end="2006">“There’s a major unmet need for more male contraceptive options. ADAM is designed to be a long-lasting yet reversible alternative to vasectomy, and we’re excited about what the data is showing so far.”</p>
<p data-start="2212" data-end="2325">The company is also working on <strong data-start="2243" data-end="2270">at-home sperm test kits</strong> so users can easily track the implant’s effectiveness.</p>

<p data-start="1855" data-end="2301"><em>&#8220;Our goal was to create a diagnostic tool that works within the unique constraints of neonatal care — minimal blood volume, rapid turnaround, and high sensitivity,&#8221; </em>said <strong data-start="2029" data-end="2047">Dr Kerwin Kwek</strong>, Research Scientist at SMART CAMP and SMART AMR. <em>&#8220;BLIPI represents a major step forward by providing clinicians with fast, actionable immune health data using a non-invasive method, where it can make a real difference for newborns in critical care.&#8221;</em></p>
<strong data-start="2311" data-end="2350">What Is BLIPI and How Does It Work?</strong>
<p data-start="2352" data-end="2687">BLIPI uses <strong data-start="2363" data-end="2390">microfluidic technology</strong> to measure how immune cells, particularly white blood cells, respond to infection by analysing changes in their <strong data-start="2505" data-end="2529">size and flexibility</strong>. This provides direct evidence of immune system activity, complementing traditional indicators like <strong data-start="2630" data-end="2686">CRP levels, white cell counts, and neutrophil ratios</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2689" data-end="3007">This real-time immune profiling was validated in a study published in <em data-start="2759" data-end="2779">Pediatric Research</em>, where 19 infants — both full-term and premature, were tested at multiple timepoints.

<p data-start="3210" data-end="3648"><em>&#8220;With BLIPI, a single prick to the baby’s finger or heel can give us rapid insights into the infant’s immune response within minutes,&#8221; </em>said <strong data-start="3354" data-end="3390">Assistant Professor Yeo Kee Thai</strong>, Senior Consultant at the Department of Neonatology at KKH. <em><em>&#8220;This allows us to tailor treatments more precisely and respond faster to give these fragile babies the best chance at a healthy start not just in their early days, but throughout their lives.&#8221;</em></em></p>
<p data-start="3650" data-end="3812">KKH, which cares for about two-thirds of all babies born weighing less than 1,500 grams in Singapore, sees BLIPI as a vital addition to its neonatal care arsenal.</p>
<strong data-start="3822" data-end="3877">Looking Ahead: Global Impact and Continued Research</strong>
<p data-start="3879" data-end="4246">The SMART and KKH team plans larger clinical trials to further validate BLIPI’s effectiveness across diverse newborn populations and medical conditions.

<p data-start="4705" data-end="4973">BLIPI is not just a diagnostic device — it’s a <strong data-start="4752" data-end="4764">lifeline</strong> for the most fragile members of society.

"BLIPI exemplifies our vision to bridge the gap between scientific innovation and clinical need,"  said Professor Jongyoon Han, co-lead Principal Investigator at SMART CAMP, Principal Investigator at SMART AMR. "By leveraging microfluidic technologies to extract real-time immune insights from whole blood, we are not only accelerating diagnostics but also redefining how we monitor immune health in fragile populations."<br />
BLIPI is not just a diagnostic device — it’s a lifeline for the most fragile members of society. Through rapid, minimally invasive, and highly accurate immune profiling, it empowers doctors to act fast and smart, offering premature babies a stronger start in life.<br />
Why is BLIPI crucial for premature infants?<br />
Premature babies have tiny blood volumes and are highly susceptible to infections. BLIPI’s low blood requirement and rapid response make it ideal for fast, life-saving decisions.<br />
Where will BLIPI be used first?<br />
BLIPI will first be deployed in Singapore’s neonatal care units like KKH, with potential for broader international implementation as trials expand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Pregnancy comes with a flurry of questions especially about what you can and should eat or drink. For many moms-to-be, traditional dairy may cause digestive issues, lactose intolerance, or just not sit right.

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">From its vitamin-rich profile to important <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-pregnancy-milk" >safety considerations</a>, this article delivers the facts you need to make confident dietary choices during this transformative time.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"> </p>
<strong>What Is Almond Milk?</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969314" class="wp-caption-text">Almond Milk for Pregnancy: Safety, Benefits &amp; How to Include It in Your Diet</p>

<p>Almond milk is a plant-based beverage made by blending soaked almonds with water and then straining the mixture. The result is a smooth, slightly nutty milk that’s naturally free from lactose and cholesterol. Commercial almond milk is often fortified with essential nutrients such as calcium, vitamin D, and B12, key players in a healthy pregnancy.</p>
<p>It comes in various forms: sweetened or unsweetened, flavored (like vanilla), and shelf-stable or refrigerated. For pregnancy, unsweetened and fortified options are generally considered best.</p>

<strong>Is Almond Milk Safe During Pregnancy?</strong>
<p>Yes, almond milk is safe to consume during pregnancy for most women. It&#8217;s a gentle, low-calorie alternative to dairy that suits many dietary preferences, including vegan and lactose-free diets. However, as with any food, moderation is key.</p>
<p>Pregnant women with nut allergies should, of course, avoid almond milk altogether. Additionally, always check for added sugars and unnecessary additives when buying store-bought options. Ideally, choose organic, unsweetened, and fortified almond milk to maximize health benefits while minimizing risks.</p>

<strong>Nutritional Benefits of Almond Milk for Pregnant Women</strong>
<strong>Low in Calories and Sugar (When Unsweetened)</strong>
<p>Unsweetened almond milk typically contains just 30–40 calories per cup, making it a light, hydrating choice for women managing pregnancy weight gain or gestational diabetes.</p>
<strong>Naturally Lactose-Free</strong>
<p>Many pregnant women develop lactose sensitivity. Almond milk is an excellent alternative that won’t cause bloating, gas, or discomfort associated with dairy.</p>
<strong>Rich in Vitamin E</strong>
<p>Almond milk is naturally high in vitamin E, an antioxidant that supports skin health and may help reduce inflammation. It also supports fetal cell development and immune function.</p>
<strong>Fortified with Calcium and Vitamin D</strong>
<p>These two nutrients are essential for building your baby’s bones and teeth. Fortified almond milk can offer up to 30% of the recommended daily intake of calcium and 25% of vitamin D per cup.</p>
<strong>Source of B Vitamins and Magnesium</strong>
<p>These micronutrients are vital for energy metabolism, nerve function, and muscle health—supporting both mother and child throughout the pregnancy journey.</p>

<strong>FAQs</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969315" class="wp-caption-text">Almond Milk for Pregnancy: Safety, Benefits &amp; How to Include It in Your Diet</p>

1. Can almond milk help with pregnancy bloating?
<p>Yes, its lactose-free composition can reduce digestive discomfort and bloating for women sensitive to dairy.</p>
2. Is it safe to drink almond milk every day while pregnant?
<p>Yes, 1–2 servings per day of fortified, unsweetened almond milk is generally safe for most pregnant women.</p>
3. Does almond milk have enough calcium for pregnancy needs?
<p>Fortified almond milk can provide significant amounts of calcium, but it should be complemented with other calcium-rich foods.</p>
4. Can almond milk affect breast milk production?
<p>There’s no evidence that almond milk interferes with lactation. It can be included as part of a balanced diet.</p>
5. Is homemade almond milk safer than store-bought?
<p>Homemade almond milk avoids additives and preservatives but may lack key fortifications like calcium and vitamin D. Choose what suits your nutritional needs best.</p>

A Gentle Boost to Your Prenatal Nutrition
<p>Almond milk isn’t just a delicious and refreshing beverage. It’s a versatile, nutrient-rich companion to your pregnancy diet. Whether you’re avoiding dairy or simply want to diversify your nutrition, this plant-based milk offers a safe and beneficial alternative.</p>
<p>Just remember to choose unsweetened, fortified versions and always check in with your healthcare provider if you have dietary restrictions or allergies.</p>
<p>With a little planning, almond milk can be a nourishing sip that supports both your well-being and your baby’s growth every step of the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Every culture has its time-honored remedies for nurturing a healthy pregnancy, and few are as celebrated or as aromatic as saffron milk. While modern medicine plays a crucial role in prenatal care, ancient remedies still hold value for many expecting mothers. Among them, <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/saffron-milk-during-pregnancy" >saffron milk</a>, a golden-hued, aromatic drink steeped in tradition.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">But how safe is it during pregnancy? Can a few strands of this luxurious spice truly benefit you and your baby?</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">This article blends time-honored wisdom with scientific research to uncover the truth about saffron milk during pregnancy.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"> </p>
<strong>What Is Saffron Milk?</strong>
<p>Saffron milk, often called <em>kesar doodh</em>, is a warm beverage made by infusing milk with a few strands of saffron. It may include other ingredients like cardamom, almonds, or turmeric, depending on cultural or personal preferences. Saffron, derived from the Crocus sativus flower, is the world&#8217;s most expensive spice by weight, prized for its distinctive aroma, vibrant color, and therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>Traditionally used in <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/is-ayurvedic-medicine-safe-during-pregnancy" >Ayurvedic medicine</a>, saffron milk is believed to boost immunity, improve complexion, and uplift mood. But during pregnancy, its benefits and risks warrant closer examination.</p>

<strong>Is Saffron Milk Safe During Pregnancy?</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969282" class="wp-caption-text">Saffron Milk During Pregnancy: Benefits, Safety, and Best Practices</p>

<p>Yes, saffron milk can be safe during pregnancy when consumed in moderation. The key is dosage. While saffron offers several potential health benefits, excessive intake may lead to uterine contractions, especially in the first trimester.</p>
<p>Most healthcare professionals and nutritionists recommend limiting saffron consumption to 2 to 3 strands per day steeped in milk, particularly after the first trimester. The spice is potent, and more is not always better.</p>
<p>As always, it&#8217;s essential to consult your OB-GYN before adding any herbal or traditional remedies to your prenatal routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions.</p>

<strong>Nutritional Benefits of Saffron Milk</strong>
<strong>Rich in Antioxidants</strong>
<p>Saffron contains powerful antioxidants like crocin, safranal, and kaempferol. These compounds help neutralize free radicals in the body, which can reduce inflammation and boost overall immunity.</p>
<strong>Promotes Healthy Digestion</strong>
<p>Digestive discomfort, including bloating and constipation, is common during pregnancy. Saffron has carminative properties that may soothe the digestive tract and improve metabolism when consumed in small quantities.</p>
<strong>Supports Emotional Well-being and Reduces Stress</strong>
<p>Hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy can affect mood. Saffron is known for its mild antidepressant effects and can help improve mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety and stress.</p>
<p>Clinical studies suggest saffron supplementation may even help with mild to moderate depression.</p>
<strong>May Help with Blood Pressure Regulation</strong>
<p>Some studies suggest saffron may support cardiovascular health by helping to regulate blood pressure and improve circulation. This is particularly helpful during pregnancy when blood volume increases and maintaining healthy blood pressure becomes crucial.</p>

<strong>Cultural Beliefs Around Saffron in Pregnancy</strong>
<p>In many Indian, Persian, and Middle Eastern cultures, saffron milk is traditionally believed to promote a fair complexion in babies, a belief not supported by science. However, its use in pregnancy is culturally linked to enhancing vitality, calming the mind, and nurturing the mother.</p>
<p>While these beliefs persist, modern healthcare professionals emphasize its nutritional rather than cosmetic value.</p>

<strong>Potential Risks of Saffron Milk During Pregnancy</strong>
<strong>Overconsumption and Uterine Contractions</strong>
<p>Saffron in high doses (more than 5 grams) is considered unsafe and may stimulate uterine contractions, potentially leading to preterm labor or miscarriage. Always stick to small quantities, just 2 to 3 strands per serving.</p>
<strong>Allergic Reactions</strong>
<p>Though rare, saffron can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals, including dry mouth, dizziness, or nausea. Discontinue use and consult your doctor if any symptoms appear.</p>
<strong>Impact on Blood Pressure for Sensitive Individuals</strong>
<p>While saffron can help stabilize blood pressure, in some cases, it may cause slight drops. If you are prone to low blood pressure, discuss this with your healthcare provider before use.</p>

<strong>Best Time to Drink Saffron Milk During Pregnancy</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969287" class="wp-caption-text">Saffron Milk During Pregnancy: Benefits, Safety, and Best Practices</p>

<p>Evening is often ideal, as saffron’s calming properties may help with better sleep. It can be introduced safely during the second trimester and continued in moderation through the third.</p>

<strong>FAQs</strong>
1. Can saffron milk help with pregnancy mood swings?
<p>Yes, saffron has natural mood-lifting properties and may help reduce anxiety and emotional stress during pregnancy.</p>
2. Is it safe to drink saffron milk daily during pregnancy?
<p>Yes, but only in small amounts—2–3 strands of saffron per day is the safe recommended limit.</p>
3. When should I start drinking saffron milk while pregnant?
<p>It’s best to start in the second trimester after consulting with your OB-GYN.</p>
4. Does saffron milk affect baby’s complexion?
<p>No, there is no scientific evidence that saffron influences skin color. Its benefits are nutritional and emotional.</p>
5. How many saffron strands are safe to use during pregnancy?
<p>Stick to 2–3 strands per day steeped in milk. Avoid excess to prevent adverse effects.</p>

<strong>A Golden Elixir in Moderation</strong>
<p>Saffron milk during pregnancy can be a warm, soothing, and nutritious addition to your diet provided it’s consumed responsibly. Rich in antioxidants, known for calming the nerves, and steeped in tradition, this luxurious spice offers more than just flavor.</p>
<p>Keep the dosage low, choose high-quality saffron, and always seek medical advice if unsure. As with many things in pregnancy, balance is everything.</p>

Supports Emotional Well-being and Reduces Stress<br />
Hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy can affect mood. Saffron is known for its mild antidepressant effects and can help improve mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety and stress.<br />
Clinical studies suggest saffron supplementation may even help with mild to moderate depression.<br />
May Help with Blood Pressure Regulation<br />
Some studies suggest saffron may support cardiovascular health by helping to regulate blood pressure and improve circulation. This is particularly helpful during pregnancy when blood volume increases and maintaining healthy blood pressure becomes crucial.</p>
<p>Cultural Beliefs Around Saffron in Pregnancy<br />
In many Indian, Persian, and Middle Eastern cultures, saffron milk is traditionally believed to promote a fair complexion in babies, a belief not supported by science. However, its use in pregnancy is culturally linked to enhancing vitality, calming the mind, and nurturing the mother.<br />
While these beliefs persist, modern healthcare professionals emphasize its nutritional rather than cosmetic value.</p>
<p>Potential Risks of Saffron Milk During Pregnancy<br />
Overconsumption and Uterine Contractions<br />
Saffron in high doses (more than 5 grams) is considered unsafe and may stimulate uterine contractions, potentially leading to preterm labor or miscarriage. Always stick to small quantities, just 2 to 3 strands per serving.<br />
Allergic Reactions<br />
Though rare, saffron can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals, including dry mouth, dizziness, or nausea. Discontinue use and consult your doctor if any symptoms appear.<br />
Impact on Blood Pressure for Sensitive Individuals<br />
While saffron can help stabilize blood pressure, in some cases, it may cause slight drops. If you are prone to low blood pressure, discuss this with your healthcare provider before use.</p>
<p>Best Time to Drink Saffron Milk During Pregnancy</p>
<p>Evening is often ideal, as saffron’s calming properties may help with better sleep. It can be introduced safely during the second trimester and continued in moderation through the third.</p>
<p>FAQs<br />
1. Can saffron milk help with pregnancy mood swings?<br />
Yes, saffron has natural mood-lifting properties and may help reduce anxiety and emotional stress during pregnancy.<br />
2. Is it safe to drink saffron milk daily during pregnancy?<br />
Yes, but only in small amounts—2–3 strands of saffron per day is the safe recommended limit.<br />
3. When should I start drinking saffron milk while pregnant?<br />
It’s best to start in the second trimester after consulting with your OB-GYN.<br />
4. Does saffron milk affect baby’s complexion?<br />
No, there is no scientific evidence that saffron influences skin color. Its benefits are nutritional and emotional.<br />
5. How many saffron strands are safe to use during pregnancy?<br />
Stick to 2–3 strands per day steeped in milk. Avoid excess to prevent adverse effects.</p>
<p>A Golden Elixir in Moderation<br />
Saffron milk during pregnancy can be a warm, soothing, and nutritious addition to your diet provided it’s consumed responsibly. Rich in antioxidants, known for calming the nerves, and steeped in tradition, this luxurious spice offers more than just flavor.<br />
Keep the dosage low, choose high-quality saffron, and always seek medical advice if unsure. As with many things in pregnancy, balance is everything.</p>

<strong>Nutritional Benefits of Oat Milk During Pregnancy</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969272" class="wp-caption-text">Is Oat Milk Good for Pregnancy? Nutritional Benefits &amp; Expert Advice</p>

<p>Oat milk brings a lot to the table especially for moms-to-be looking for a gentle, lactose-free milk option.</p>
<strong>1. High in Fiber for Digestive Support</strong>
<p>Pregnancy often slows digestion, leading to bloating and constipation. Oat milk, rich in soluble fiber like beta-glucan, promotes regular bowel movements and a healthy gut.</p>
<strong>2. Fortified with Essential Nutrients</strong>
<p>Most commercial oat milk brands are fortified with:</p>


<p><strong>Calcium and Vitamin D</strong>: For fetal bone development</p>


<p><strong>Vitamin B12</strong>: Supports neurological health</p>


<p><strong>Folic Acid</strong>: Reduces risk of neural tube defects</p>


<strong>3. Heart-Healthy and Low in Saturated Fat</strong>
<p>Oat milk contains heart-supporting compounds like beta-glucans and is naturally low in saturated fats and cholesterol, making it a heart-smart choice during pregnancy.</p>
<strong>4. Gentle on the Stomach and Allergen-Friendly</strong>
<p>Oat milk is lactose-free, making it suitable for women with dairy intolerance. It’s also a safe option for those with soy or nut allergies, provided it’s certified gluten-free if needed.</p>

<strong>Potential Drawbacks and Considerations</strong>
<p>Despite its many benefits, oat milk isn’t perfect.</p>
1. Lower in Protein
<p>Compared to dairy or soy milk, oat milk has less protein. Ensure you’re supplementing with other protein-rich foods like legumes, eggs, or lean meats.</p>
2. Watch for Added Sugars
<p>Some flavored oat milks contain high levels of added sugar. Opt for unsweetened, fortified versions to keep your sugar intake in check.</p>
3. Gluten Cross-Contamination
<p>Though oats are naturally gluten-free, contamination can occur. If you&#8217;re gluten-sensitive, make sure to choose certified gluten-free oat milk.</p>

<strong>Expert Recommendations</strong>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969273" class="wp-caption-text">Is Oat Milk Good for Pregnancy? Nutritional Benefits &amp; Expert Advice</p>

<p>Registered dietitians and obstetricians generally agree that oat milk is safe and beneficial during pregnancy when consumed in moderation. One to two servings per day can comfortably fit into a well-rounded prenatal diet, especially when using fortified brands.</p>
<strong>FAQs</strong>
1. Can I drink oat milk every day while pregnant?
<p>Yes, up to 1–2 servings daily of fortified, unsweetened oat milk is generally considered safe and beneficial.</p>
2. Is oat milk safe in the first trimester?
<p>Yes, its gentle nature and folic acid content support early fetal development and digestion.</p>
3. Does oat milk have enough calcium for pregnancy?
<p>Fortified oat milk typically contains similar calcium levels to cow’s milk. Always check the label.</p>
4. Is oat milk good for gestational diabetes?
<p>Unsweetened oat milk may be suitable due to its fiber content, but always consult your doctor.</p>
5. Can oat milk cause bloating during pregnancy?
<p>It’s generally easy to digest, but those sensitive to fiber or gluten should choose carefully.</p>

<strong>A Comforting Choice With Nutritional Merit</strong>
<p>So, is oat milk good for pregnancy? 100% YES, when chosen wisely. Its fiber content, fortification with essential nutrients, and smooth, comforting texture make it a wonderful addition to many prenatal diets. Just be mindful of added sugars and pair it with protein-rich foods to round out your nutrition.</p>
<p>As always, consult your healthcare provider to tailor your choices to your unique needs. With a little care, oat milk can be more than just a dairy alternative. It can be a nourishing companion on your journey to motherhood.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Community is out there. And your child — just like Amelie — is more than their diagnosis.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="227" data-end="715">You never forget the moment your world shifts. For Benita, 43, that moment came quietly but decisively — not with a dramatic announcement, but during what was supposed to be a routine check-up at KK Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s Hospital. Her daughter Amelie, then just shy of three years old, had been admitted for a febrile seizure.</p>
<p data-start="227" data-end="715">But something else caught the doctor’s attention.</p>
<p data-start="227" data-end="715">When asked for her name, Amelie didn’t respond. She wasn’t engaging the way most children her age typically would.</p>
<p data-start="717" data-end="951">That small interaction sparked a journey that would forever change how Benita saw her daughter — and herself. After a referral to a Developmental and Behavioural Paediatrician, the confirmation came.</p>
<p data-start="717" data-end="951">Amelie was on the autism spectrum.</p>
<p data-start="953" data-end="1290">As a parent, you might find yourself grappling with the same storm of emotions. Denial. Guilt. Sleepless nights filled with questions. Benita did.</p>

<p data-start="953" data-end="1290"><em><strong>“I spent nights crying, questioning what had gone wrong — from my pregnancy to my parenting,”</strong></em> she recalls. <em><strong>“The diagnosis hit hard. There was guilt, fear, and deep uncertainty.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="1297" data-end="1348"> </p>
<strong data-start="1297" data-end="1348">Living With Autism is Not Less — Just Different</strong>

<p data-start="1350" data-end="1628">It’s okay to grieve the expectations you had. It’s okay to feel lost at first. But Benita wants you to know that a diagnosis of autism isn’t a life sentence. It’s a different roadmap. And it can be a gift. For her, receiving Amelie’s diagnosis brought not despair, but clarity.</p>

<p data-start="1630" data-end="2033"><em><strong>“It gave me permission to understand and accept her for who she truly is, rather than trying to fit her into neurotypical milestones,”</strong></em> she shares.</p>

<p data-start="1630" data-end="2033">That acceptance shifted everything. She stopped trying to correct behaviours like stimming or delayed responses. She began to build a parenting style that was structured yet loving, one that gave Amelie the predictability and clarity she needed to thrive.</p>
<p data-start="2035" data-end="2212">As a parent, you might feel like you&#8217;re drowning in unknowns. But as Benita’s story shows, the journey through autism can become one of empowerment, understanding, and even joy.</p>

<p><em><strong>&#8220;It took time to accept that Amelie was not “less,” but simply wired differently. &#8220;</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2219" data-end="2254"> </p>
<strong data-start="2219" data-end="2254">When Support Systems Fall Short</strong>
<p data-start="2256" data-end="2603">In Singapore, early intervention services do exist — but they’re often hard to access. After Amelie’s diagnosis, Benita was advised to enrol her in government-provided therapy. What she quickly discovered was how limited those sessions were.</p>

<p data-start="2256" data-end="2603"><em><strong>“Sometimes it was only once a quarter. It wasn’t enough,”</strong></em> she says. <em><strong>“We needed something more intensive.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2605" data-end="2993">So she did what many parents in her position do: she became a researcher, advocate, and warrior — all in one. Books, podcasts, online searches — she left no stone unturned.</p>
<p data-start="2605" data-end="2993">That’s how she found Bridging the Gap (BtG) in 2022. The multidisciplinary, integrated approach they offered was a breath of fresh air. For families looking for more than a piecemeal solution, BtG became a lifeline.</p>
</p>

<p data-start="3000" data-end="3046"> </p>
<strong data-start="3000" data-end="3046">The Cost of Care</strong>
<p data-start="3048" data-end="3397">If you&#8217;re raising a child with autism, you know the financial strain is real. Therapy, assessments, specialist consultations — they all add up. For Benita’s family of six, surviving on one income, it wasn’t easy.</p>

<p data-start="3048" data-end="3397"><em><strong>“Budgeting for Amelie’s therapy was tough,”</strong></em> she says. But there was more than just the financial cost. There was the emotional one, too.</p>
<p data-start="3399" data-end="3650"><em><strong>“I had to educate myself from scratch on what autism really meant,”</strong></em> she shares. <em><strong>“There’s no manual. You’re constantly learning, adapting, and sometimes, failing.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="3399" data-end="3650">But she kept going — driven by love, by hope, and by the strength of her support system.</p>
<p data-start="3652" data-end="3839">Her husband, she says, has been her greatest pillar. Together, they’ve learned to lean on each other. And with BtG offering consistent, evidence-based care, they began to feel less alone.</p>
<p data-start="3846" data-end="3876"> </p>
<strong data-start="3846" data-end="3876">Small Wins, Big Milestones</strong>
<p data-start="3878" data-end="4174">Since starting at BtG, Amelie’s progress has been profound. She’s more focused, communicates more clearly, and is learning to navigate the world with increasing independence.</p>


<p data-start="3878" data-end="4174"><em><strong>“She can now balance on one foot, write with proper grip, and even wait safely to cross the road,”</strong></em> Benita shares proudly.</p>

<p data-start="4176" data-end="4386">These may seem like small milestones to others — but to a parent of a child with autism, they are everything. They are hard-won, deeply cherished, and proof that early, holistic intervention makes a difference.</p>
<p data-start="4393" data-end="4444"> </p>
<strong data-start="4393" data-end="4444">Autism and the Long Road to Emotional Endurance</strong>
<p data-start="4446" data-end="4661">As the years have passed, Benita has grown into her role as a caregiver with wisdom, patience, and emotional resilience. But the toll is real.</p>

<p data-start="4446" data-end="4661"><em><strong>“It’s been a journey of joy, worry, exhaustion, and growth,”</strong> </em>she admits.</p>

<p data-start="4663" data-end="4996">If you&#8217;re in the thick of it right now, know this: you’re not weak for feeling tired. You’re not failing for needing help. And you deserve a support system that holds you up when you can&#8217;t do it alone. For Benita, that includes her husband, her community, and centres like BtG that walk this road with families every step of the way.</p>
<p data-start="5003" data-end="5036"> </p>
<strong data-start="5003" data-end="5036">True Inclusion Starts With Us</strong>
<p data-start="5038" data-end="5301">Autism is not just a condition to be managed — it’s a way of seeing the world. And that world, Benita argues, needs to do better.</p>

<p data-start="5038" data-end="5301"><em><strong>“True inclusion means recognising that every child — regardless of ability — deserves to be seen, supported, and accepted,”</strong></em> she says.</p>

<p data-start="5303" data-end="5597">Buzzwords won’t change hearts. Actions will. Inclusion means training educators, redesigning public spaces, and most importantly, teaching our own children that different is not deficient.</p>
<p data-start="5303" data-end="5597">If Amelie is to thrive in Singapore, we all need to make space for her — and others like her — to belong.</p>

<p data-start="0" data-end="456" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Even though Singapore has one of the lowest maternal death rates in the world, <a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/heart-disease-in-females-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cardiovascular disease</a> is still one of the top causes of maternal deaths. With more women choosing to have kids later in life, it’s becoming even more important to look after heart health during pregnancy. Dr. Kua Jieli, an Interventional Cardiologist at Carrington Cardiology and to: Dr Harvard Lin, Consultant Obstetrician, Gynaecologist and Urogynaecologist at the Asian Obstetric and Gynaecology Centre (AOGC) share expert tips on how to manage heart conditions during pregnancy and reduce long-term heart risks.</p>









<strong data-start="713" data-end="748">How Pregnancy Affects the Heart</strong>
<p data-start="750" data-end="1121">During pregnancy, a woman’s body goes through a lot of changes to support the baby — especially the heart and blood vessels.</p>
<p data-start="750" data-end="1121">According to Dr. Kua, &#8220;<em>Blood volume and the amount of blood the heart pumps go up by about 50%, while blood vessels relax and widen to help with flow, especially by the second trimester. The heart itself also changes; its size increases, and the main artery, the aorta, becomes more flexible.</em>&#8221; These changes are caused by pregnancy hormones like oestrogen, progesterone, and relaxin, which also help the placenta grow and make sure the baby gets enough blood and nutrients.</p>
<p data-start="1123" data-end="1311">For older mothers or women with pre-existing heart conditions, these changes can lead to complications like preeclampsia, stillbirth, early delivery, poor foetal growth, or heart problems during or after pregnancy, if not properly monitored.</p>
<strong data-start="1321" data-end="1378">Pregnancy Complications That Signal Future Heart Risk</strong>
<p data-start="1380" data-end="1534">Certain pregnancy complications serve as early indicators of heightened cardiovascular risk later in life. Dr. Kua identifies key conditions to watch for:</p>
<a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/preeclampsia-symptoms-treatments-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener" ><strong data-start="1540" data-end="1585">Preeclampsia</strong></a>
<p>This is when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and often protein in her urine. It’s linked to a 2 to 4 times higher risk of getting high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or heart failure in the future.</p>
<strong data-start="1540" data-end="1585">Gestational Hypertension</strong>
<p data-start="415" data-end="684"><a href="https://sg.theasianparent.com/gestational-hypertension-symptoms-causes-impacts-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Gestational hypertension</a> means high blood pressure that starts during pregnancy, but without protein in the urine. It may go away after delivery, but it can be an early sign that the woman might develop long-term high blood pressure or heart disease later on.</p>
<strong data-start="1789" data-end="1813">Gestational Diabetes</strong>

<p data-start="3739" data-end="3856"><strong data-start="3739" data-end="3757">&#8220;Pregnancy is a time to enjoy eating for two people.&#8221; </strong>While it&#8217;s true that pregnant women need more nutrition, it should never be to the point that they&#8217;re meeting the caloric needs for two people. Excessive weight gain can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. A balanced diet is key. Plan to <em>gain </em><em>only 2.3kg in the first half of pregnancy and 0.5kg per week thereafter</em>. </p>


<p data-start="3859" data-end="3937"><strong data-start="3859" data-end="3883">&#8220;Eating spicy foods while pregnant can cause birth defects or harm the baby.&#8221;</strong> There is no evidence to suggest spicy foods can harm a developing foetus.

<p data-start="3940" data-end="4053"><strong data-start="3940" data-end="3971">&#8220;It is harmful to the baby when women sleep on their back.&#8221;</strong> There’s no need to panic if a pregnant woman ends up sleeping on her back — but there’s a bit of truth behind the concern. As the baby bump gets bigger, it can press down on a big vein called the inferior vena cava, which brings blood back to the heart. When this vein gets squashed, less blood flows back to the heart and around the body, including to the womb. This might make some women feel dizzy, sweaty, or even a bit nauseous.</p>


<p data-start="4056" data-end="4199"><strong data-start="4056" data-end="4092">&#8220;Keeping a pregnant woman’s heart rate lower than 140 bpm.&#8221;</strong> This outdated advice is no longer supported.

<strong data-start="1723" data-end="1798">What Are Preventive Measures to Avoid Heart Issues in Pregnant Women?</strong>
<p data-start="1800" data-end="2075">Preventive care is fundamental to reducing cardiovascular complications during pregnancy. A heart-healthy lifestyle—balanced nutrition, regular light-to-moderate exercise, and avoiding harmful substances like tobacco and alcohol—lays the groundwork for maternal well-being.</p>
<p data-start="2077" data-end="2410">In addition to lifestyle, managing existing risk factors is essential. Conditions such as hypertension and diabetes must be controlled before and during pregnancy to prevent complications. Routine prenatal care allows early detection of warning signs, such as elevated blood pressure, which may indicate conditions like preeclampsia.</p>
<p data-start="2412" data-end="2701">Education plays a pivotal role in prevention. Dr. Kua advises that women should seek immediate medical attention for “<em data-start="2530" data-end="2645">chest pain, severe breathlessness (especially at rest), rapid weight gain, palpitations, or episodes of fainting,</em>” as these may indicate serious cardiovascular problems.</p>
<p data-start="2703" data-end="2862">By empowering women with knowledge and ensuring timely medical intervention, many pregnancy-related heart complications can be mitigated or avoided altogether.</p>

<p data-start="237" data-end="438">Starting with preconception counselling, It should include cardiovascular risk assessment, especially for those who are older, have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a history of heart problems</p>
<p data-start="440" data-end="838">During pregnancy, doctors from different specialities can come together to create a joint care plan for women with heart issues, whether pre-existing or newly diagnosed. Regular updates between the teams help make sure treatments are adjusted when needed. For high-risk pregnancies, a team that includes maternal-foetal medicine specialists, cardiologists, and anaesthesiologists can work together to ensure safer delivery.</p>
<p data-start="840" data-end="1183" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">After giving birth, it’s still important to monitor heart health, as some conditions, like pregnancy-related heart conditions like peripartum cardiomyopathy or hypertension, can continue or even show up for the first time postpartum.

<strong data-start="4711" data-end="4778">Improving Healthcare Systems for Better Postpartum Heart Health</strong>

<p>This means cardiologists, OB-GYNs, maternal-foetal medicine specialists, and family doctors should all work closely together to make sure mums get smooth, continuous care from delivery to long-term heart management.</p>
<p data-start="423" data-end="822">To prevent women with pregnancy-related heart risks from falling through the cracks, hospitals and clinics should set up structured referral systems and personalised follow-up plans.

<p>Healthcare professionals can also help by:</p>


<p data-start="852" data-end="932">Doing standard heart health checks before discharge and during follow-up visits.</p>

With more women choosing to have kids later in life, it’s becoming even more important to look after heart health during pregnancy. Dr. Kua Jieli, an Interventional Cardiologist at Carrington Cardiology and to: Dr Harvard Lin, Consultant Obstetrician, Gynaecologist and Urogynaecologist at the Asian Obstetric and Gynaecology Centre (AOGC) share expert tips on how to manage heart conditions during pregnancy and reduce long-term heart risks.</p>
<p>How Pregnancy Affects the Heart<br />
During pregnancy, a woman’s body goes through a lot of changes to support the baby — especially the heart and blood vessels.<br />
According to Dr. Kua, "Blood volume and the amount of blood the heart pumps go up by about 50%, while blood vessels relax and widen to help with flow, especially by the second trimester. The heart itself also changes; its size increases, and the main artery, the aorta, becomes more flexible." These changes are caused by pregnancy hormones like oestrogen, progesterone, and relaxin, which also help the placenta grow and make sure the baby gets enough blood and nutrients.<br />
For older mothers or women with pre-existing heart conditions, these changes can lead to complications like preeclampsia, stillbirth, early delivery, poor foetal growth, or heart problems during or after pregnancy, if not properly monitored.<br />
Pregnancy Complications That Signal Future Heart Risk<br />
Certain pregnancy complications serve as early indicators of heightened cardiovascular risk later in life. Dr. Kua identifies key conditions to watch for:<br />
Preeclampsia<br />
This is when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and often protein in her urine. It’s linked to a 2 to 4 times higher risk of getting high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or heart failure in the future.<br />
Gestational Hypertension<br />
Gestational hypertension means high blood pressure that starts during pregnancy, but without protein in the urine. It may go away after delivery, but it can be an early sign that the woman might develop long-term high blood pressure or heart disease later on.<br />
Gestational Diabetes<br />
Gestational diabetes shows up during pregnancy but usually goes away afterwards. However, it raises the risk of getting type 2 diabetes, metabolic issues, and coronary artery disease down the road.<br />
Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR)<br />
This is when the baby grows too slowly in the womb. It may point to issues with the mother’s blood flow or placenta, and could be a sign of deeper heart or blood vessel problems.<br />
Pre-Term Birth<br />
Giving birth too early can be linked to inflammation and blood vessel problems, which increase the mum’s long-term risk of heart disease.<br />
Stillbirth<br />
Women who experience stillbirth have a higher long-term risk of heart disease, including stroke and myocardial infarction.<br />
“These complications may act as a 'stress test' that reveals hidden problems with blood vessels or metabolism,” Dr. Kua emphasises.<br />
Recognising Early Signs of Cardiovascular Issues During Pregnancy<br />
Many early heart disease symptoms mirror typical pregnancy complaints and are often dismissed. Dr. Kua advises paying close attention to:</p>
<p>Chest pain</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Light-headedness</p>
<p>Tachycardia rapid heart rate (&gt;100 bpm)</p>
<p>Shortness of breath, especially at rest</p>
<p>	Persistent cough</p>
<p>Swelling in the limbs</p>
<p>Frequent nighttime urination</p>
<p>“Symptoms can appear during pregnancy or up to a year postpartum. If persistent, they may indicate a life-threatening cardiovascular condition,” he cautions.<br />
How Can Pregnant Women Manage Heart Disease?<br />
Managing heart conditions during pregnancy requires a combination of proactive planning, vigilant monitoring, and a team-based medical approach. According to Dr. Kua Jieli, “Managing heart problems during pregnancy involves careful planning, close monitoring, and a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to ensure the safety of both mother and baby.”<br />

Physicians closely observe symptoms like palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling, which may signal deterioration. Safe medications may include beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics for fluid control, and aspirin for preeclampsia risk reduction.<br />

Postpartum, the first six weeks are particularly critical, especially for patients with conditions like peripartum cardiomyopathy, necessitating continued monitoring.<br />

					<description><![CDATA[What started as a simple act of support soon turned into something much bigger.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-start="159" data-end="418">You’re probably familiar with <a href="https://hairforhope.org.sg/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hair for Hope</a> — the iconic annual campaign that sees brave souls across Singapore shaving their heads in solidarity with children battling cancer.</p>
<p data-start="159" data-end="418">But have you ever wondered what keeps some people coming back year after year?</p>
<p data-start="420" data-end="753">Meet Jason Ong. He’s a father of two, a consulting manager in the telecom industry, and one of Hair for Hope’s longest-running ambassadors. For 13 years, Jason has shaved, shared, rallied, and repeated — turning a single act of compassion into a lifelong mission to support families facing one of the toughest battles imaginable.</p>
<p data-start="755" data-end="1046">As Singapore celebrates its 60th birthday, the Children’s Cancer Foundation is spotlighting powerful human-interest stories to kick off Hair for Hope 2025.</p>
<p data-start="755" data-end="1046">And Jason’s journey is one worth hearing — not just for the legacy he’s built, but for the community he’s inspired along the way.</p>
<p data-start="755" data-end="1046"> </p>
The First Shave and the Unexpected Chain Reaction
<p data-start="1110" data-end="1307">Jason first picked up the clippers back in 2008. What started as a simple act of support soon turned into something much bigger. Not only did he keep coming back to shave, but he also began organizing satellite events to grow the movement.</p>

<p data-start="1110" data-end="1307"><em><strong>“When I first shaved, my kids were still very young. I don’t think they really understood what was going on,”</strong></em> he recalls.</p>

<p data-start="1309" data-end="1546">But over time, the ritual became a teaching moment — a way to pass on values like empathy, resilience, and purpose. You know how it’s usually the organizers who chase people down? In Jason’s case, it was the opposite. His fellow “shavees” (yes, that’s a word) would beat him to the punch—emailing him months in advance to ask when the next satellite event was happening.</p>
<p data-start="1309" data-end="1546">That’s when he knew: this wasn’t just a one-off effort. It had become a community.</p>

<p data-start="1309" data-end="1546"><em><strong>“Each year when I shaved, I explained to them why I was doing it — to support children with cancer and their families.”</strong></em></p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969132" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Hair for Hope</p>


<p data-start="1548" data-end="1777">In 2010, when Jason organised his first Hair for Hope satellite event, he tried to get his son and daughter — then 10 and 8 years old — to join him on stage.</p>

<p data-start="1548" data-end="1777"><em><strong>“I kept pressing them to shave, but they kept refusing,”</strong></em> he laughs.</p>

<p data-start="1779" data-end="1818">Until one day, his son surprised him.</p>

<p data-start="1820" data-end="2033"><em><strong>“Just before the event, he told me he wanted to shave. I asked him why he changed his mind, and he said a classmate had cancer — he wanted to support him. I was really touched. It meant the message had sunk in.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2035" data-end="2426">That same day, Jason’s daughter joined her brother in solidarity.</p>

<p data-start="2035" data-end="2426"><em><strong>“Both of them shaved at the first satellite event. My son continued into his secondary school years, and my daughter shaved again when she was 12 and 16. They’ve stopped shaving for now — they’re quite attached to their hair — but they still help out at events, ushering and setting up. They’re still part of the movement.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="2035" data-end="2426">Even as the kids grew older and stopped shaving their heads, they never stopped showing up. These days, they’re right there beside him at the events, helping with logistics—ushering guests, setting up stations, and quietly making things run smoothly behind the scenes.</p>
<p data-start="2035" data-end="2426"> </p>
What Keeps Jason Coming Back?
<p data-start="2948" data-end="3185">Motivation is a funny thing. You’d think after 13 years, the enthusiasm might fade. But for Jason, it’s only grown. When people around you believe in a cause so deeply that they nudge <em data-start="3132" data-end="3137">you</em> about the next event, that’s something special.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969127" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Hair for Hope</p>

<p data-start="3187" data-end="3412">He’s seen the campaign evolve, watched his shavees return year after year, and built bonds with strangers who eventually became friends. That kind of community doesn’t just happen—it takes someone like Jason to make it stick.</p>
<p data-start="3414" data-end="3771">And if you&#8217;re wondering what it&#8217;s like to shave your head for the first time, Jason gets the hesitation. Will the hair grow back the same? Will I look weird bald? Valid concerns. But as he likes to say, it’s worth doing at least once—if not for the look, then for the lesson.</p>
<p data-start="3414" data-end="3771">More importantly, you’re showing children battling cancer that they’re not alone.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969128" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Hair for Hope</p>

<p data-start="3414" data-end="3771"> </p>
Busting the Bald Myths
<p data-start="3806" data-end="3935">Let’s address the elephant in the room. Yes, shaving your head is a bold move. And no, it’s not a “get out of shampoo free” card.</p>

<p data-start="3402" data-end="3551"><em><strong>“I know many people want to support, but they’re afraid,”</strong></em> he says. <em><strong>“Some worry their hair won’t grow back. Others worry they won’t look good bald.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="3553" data-end="3593">His advice? Give it a try — just once.</p>
</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-969131" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Hair for Hope</p>

<p data-start="3937" data-end="4247">Jason laughs about how people often assume shaving means less effort. But in reality, scalp care is still a thing—especially in sunny Singapore. Even with a smooth head, you’ll need proper washing, sunscreen, and yes, shampoo.</p>
<p data-start="3937" data-end="4247">The key message? Don’t let vanity or myths hold you back from doing something good.</p>
<p data-start="3937" data-end="4247"> </p>
Together, We Can&#8230; And Should
<p data-start="4047" data-end="4152">This year’s theme for Hair for Hope is “Together, We Can” — and it perfectly sums up Jason’s journey.</p>
<p data-start="4154" data-end="4341">Through his efforts, Jason has not only supported children with cancer — he’s rallied a community, instilled lifelong values in his kids, and shown what it means to be an everyday hero.</p>

<p data-start="4343" data-end="4624"><em><strong>“For anyone going through cancer, or who has a loved one battling it — you are not alone,”</strong></em> Jason says. <em><strong>“Your family is there for you. But beyond that, there’s a big community of people, like us, who are here to support you. We may not know you personally, but we stand with you.”</strong></em></p>

<p data-start="5434" data-end="5618">If Jason’s story moved you, maybe it’s time to take that leap yourself. Hair for Hope 2025 is more than just a campaign—it’s a national movement of solidarity, compassion, and courage.</p>
<p data-start="5620" data-end="5709">Don’t worry about the bald head. Worry about the kind of impact you want to leave behind.</p>
<p data-start="5711" data-end="5783">Because who knows? Maybe next year, it’ll be your story we’re sharing.</p>

Established in 2018, this enrichment centre is one of Singapore’s leading technology education providers and comes with a list of impressive credentials. It has been awarded the STEM.org Accredited trustmark, and is a silver winner for Best Technology Education Enrichment Centre in our Singapore Education Awards 2024. More impressively, Nullspace is the appointed vendor by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to run the Computer Enrichment Programme for all nine Gifted Education Programme primary schools in the country from 2018-2025.

EduFirst also covers a wide range of primary and secondary school subjects on top of the usual English, Chinese, maths, and science; even including history, geography, social studies, principles of accounting, the three sciences, and add maths. We love that classes are intentionally kept small here, with only four to eight students per class. This means that each kid receives individualised attention, including learning materials that are tailored to their academic needs. These materials are personally prepared by the centre’s tutors, who are all experienced and trained at the National Institute of Education. Plus, they’re just a WhatsApp or phone call away should you have any questions about your kids’ progress. You can also easily find an EduFirst branch near you too, as it has 25 centres around Singapore, including Aljunied, Bukit Timah, Jurong, Pasir Ris, and more.</p>

<h3>3. Academia</h3>

<ul>
<li>Top-notch tutors with stellar academic credentials</li>
<li>Proven track record</li>
<li>For children in Primary 1 and above</li>
</ul>
<p>These days, it’s all about finding that sweet spot between proven results and our children&#8217;s enjoyment. Founded by a Princeton grad and local top student, <strong>Academia</strong> checks all the boxes by reframing studying in another light as, in their words, learning should never be a chore. Indeed, Academia is all about instilling confidence in students. After all, what is a well-oiled car without a competent driver? Guided by a skilled team of expert instructors, each lesson is specially curated to students’ specific needs. You won’t find a curriculum that’s boring or plain old cookie-cutter here; the instructors go all out of their way to incorporate students’ interests to make the whole experience engaging for the students. The school never stays complacent either, constantly refreshing its curriculum to ensure that lessons are up-to-date. If you or your child need continued support, rest assured that Academia also offers a stellar tutor roster — including graduates from top local universities, Ivy League institutions, and Oxbridge — to give much-needed guidance (and moral support) when applying to universities. Not convinced? Let Academia’s track record speak for itself: it has achieved an almost 100% rate of A/B for O-Level English, and more than 70% Distinction rate for A-Level GP. Each year, more than half of their students score AL1s for their PSLE English. Now, how’s that for a crowning achievement?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://honeykidsasia.com/international-schools-prepare-students-real-world/">Life beyond school: How these international schools are preparing students for the real world</a></p>
<p>There’s one thing that all <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/singapore-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schools</a> have in common: they all share a mission in developing students who are educated, <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/life-skills-singapore-parents-should-teach-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent</a>, and able to contribute to society. In essence, every aspect of the schooling experience goes towards preparing students to take the big step into the real world after <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/moving-on-how-international-schools-are-prepping-our-kids-for-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graduation</a>.</p>
<p>However, the ‘real world’ as we know it is changing rapidly at an unprecedented pace. This also means that our children will be facing never-before-seen challenges when it’s time to leave school. As such, it’s more important than ever for schools to ensure their students are equipped with real-world skills and be <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/preparing-future-ready-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future-ready</a>.</p>
<p>We spoke to some of Singapore’s top international schools to find out how they prepare students to take on the real world.</p>
<h3>Nexus International School (Singapore)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-212127" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Resizing-2-2.jpg" alt="real world nexus" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Resizing-2-2.jpg 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Resizing-2-2-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Resizing-2-2-768x549.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p>Year 9 to 13 learners at Nexus International School (Singapore) get prepped for the world beyond school walls through the Careers and University Programme. This programme is delivered through the joint efforts of Nexus’ Careers and University Counsellors, International Baccalaureate Coordinators, Phase Leaders, and even the learners’ teachers themselves.</p>
<p>The programme starts in Year 9, where the main focus is for learners to find out more about their skills and interests, as well as get to know themselves as an individual. In Year 10, learners are encouraged to discuss their aspirations for the future as they sit for a series of psychometric tests and quizzes. Not only do these help with subject recommendations as they move on to higher grade levels, they also serve as a foundation for the NEXSteps Career Programme. As they progress to Years 10 to 12, learners get to participate in the exciting NexSteps workshops where they learn about entrepreneurship and career exploration. Last but not least, Year 12 learners get one-on-one sessions with their guidance counsellor all the way through their final year.</p>
<p>Learners are always thrilled to join the NexSteps workshops, which includes activities like the Young Founders School bootcamp led by seasoned entrepreneurs and industry leaders; as well as panel talks featuring representatives from Apple, Google, Airbnb, and more. On top of these, learners get to benefit from the annual NexSteps Future Readiness Career Fair not just to learn about career options, but also get interview tips from employees of companies like Apple and CIMB. Another highlight of the workshops is the mock job interview sessions organised by Nexus, which allow learners to gain valuable insights about their curriculum vitae (CV) and interview responses. Tailored university sessions are prepared for Year 12 learners to find out more about university and course requirements, as well as workshops on college essay-writing, practice interviews, and even one on writing a strong CV.</p>

<h3>Tanglin Trust School</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225410" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225410" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tanglin-900x643.jpg" alt="real world tanglin trust school 2025" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tanglin-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tanglin-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tanglin.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225410" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Tanglin Trust School</figcaption></figure>
<p>Curious as to how the gold winner for International School with the Most Future-Ready Students preps its students for the real world? Tanglin Trust School’s students and families have <a href="https://www.tts.edu.sg/the-institute" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Institute @ Tanglin</a> to thank for.</p>
<p>The Institute is set up to inspire, challenge, and prepare the school’s students to step up into their role as future leaders. This is done through inviting thought leaders across disciplines for speaker events and various programmes with industry partners. The Institute recently concluded its successful Centenary ‘Future Of’ speaker series, which featured experts in forward thinking areas of AI, robotics, future of medical health, and geopolitics. Its programmes also bring in industry experts to coach and work directly with students.</p>
<p>Here’s a peek: The Institute held a 16-week Entrepreneurship Programme in partnership with Reactor School, which saw four Sixth Form student teams pitch their business ideas to a judging panel consisting of business leaders and venture builders. Tanglin’s students examined real-world problems based on United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and came up with solutions, which they then turned into fully developed prototypes and pitched for ‘pre-seed’ funding – just like in the real world! EduBot, the team that won the best pitch prize had a scalable, feasible business idea (with an interested investor secured) to improve educational outcomes in rural Indonesia. Initiatives like this creates opportunities to broaden interdisciplinary thinking, encourage creativity, innovation, and challenge students, ensuring they have what it takes to flourish within school and beyond.</p>

<p>For neurodivergent young adults, navigating the real world comes with its own unique set of challenges. Aside from the dynamic nature of the job market, neurodivergent youths also face hurdles in the form of communication barriers, sensory sensitivity, executive function struggles, as well as possible limited understanding of neurodiversity on the employer’s part.</p>
<p>As an inclusive school that also caters to youths with special needs, The GUILD International College is on a mission to bridge this gap in the labour market and help its students succeed. Pre-vocational and vocational training, as well as job readiness skill development are crucial elements in the college’s Transition Programme and Career Pathways Programmes. Students as young as 16 can participate in these programmes, where they pick up digital office skills, teaching assistant training, culinary skills in baking, hotel operations training, and floristry, just to name a few. The GUILD International College has a specialised in-house Job Coach too, who offers ongoing guidance and support to students throughout their transition journey.</p>
<p>Efforts to help students transition don’t just take place within college walls. The GUILD International College actually provides training to potential employers about the different disabilities, even supporting them on making the workplace inclusive for neurodivergent youths. There are also partnerships between the college and organisations to create internship opportunities for its students. Last but not least, educators, therapists, and counsellors of the college work closely with students and their families to create a transition that’s holistic and seamless for them.</p>

<h3>ISS International School</h3>

<p>Aside from the IB, students at ISS International School have the option to pursue the American-style High School Diploma (HSD) programme from Grade 9. This is a student-centred programme that prioritises competency-based learning, with a curriculum that focuses on real-world skill mastery that prepares students for admission to top universities around the world. It also stands out as a collaborative effort among students, parents, and educators, who all come together to create a supportive and empowering educational environment for the students.</p>
<p>In the HSD, students take on both academic and specialised courses that allow them to explore and deep-dive into their respective interests. A portfolio component – which may cover anything from awareness campaigns to entrepreneurship projects – is included to provide students with a beyond-classroom learning experience. They’re also required to complete a final year project that solves real-world problems under the guidance of a mentor (usually an industry professional that’s related to their projects and areas of interest). Last but not least, ISS regularly collaborates with experts and international organisations to facilitate guest speaker sessions for its students.</p>
<p>ISS’ Head of HSD Mr. Kelly Millar describes the programme as one that looks beyond exam scores. “The HSD programme is not just about achieving high test scores, but measures success by the impactful qualities students bring to their lives and communities. This is an immersive learning experience that cultivates practical skills, ensuring students navigate real-world challenges with assurance and resilience.” The programme has made an excellent impact on its students, including Sebastian from Grade 12: “I feel assured and well-prepared. This is not just a programme; it is my guiding compass, equipping me to navigate and conquer the challenges of the real world ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-193348" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Resizing-5.jpg" alt="ifs gold winner best learning support 2022" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Resizing-5.jpg 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Resizing-5-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Resizing-5-768x549.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p>The French education system places significant importance on equipping students with an extensive set of “real world skills”. These skills include language proficiency and communication, critical thinking, math and science competence, cultural literacy, digital literacy, research and information literacy, global awareness, as well as citizenship and ethics. Students are equipped with these at International French School (Singapore), as the school follows a comprehensive educational approach that goes beyond traditional academics. Through emphasis on these skills, IFS ensures that its students grow into academically proficient, well-rounded individuals who are able to excel in diverse contexts and make meaningful contributions to the world.</p>
<p>In line with the French education system, IFS encourages students to participate in extracurricular activities (ECAs) that align with their interests; while promoting skills like leadership, teamwork, and creativity. For instance, student-led independent research projects fosters curiosity and willingness to tackle challenges. Strong communication skills, acquired through activities such as public speaking and debates, are crucial for post-high school success. Digital literacy and technology are integrated into IFS’ curriculum to prepare students for the modern digital landscape. It also has a University Guidance Program that assists students in identifying their career goals, selecting suitable universities and programmes, as well as preparing application materials. On top of that, internship opportunities are offered to provide students with real-world experience and skills development. But that’s not all – mental health and wellbeing of students are prioritised at IFS too. Its <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/ifs-counselling-centre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secondary School counselling programme</a> focuses on student wellbeing and offering support in all aspects of their school life. Counsellors address students&#8217; unique needs, promote a healthy lifestyle and a sense of purpose beyond education, ultimately preparing them for life.</p>

<h3>Sir Manasseh Meyer International School</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-205837" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smmis.jpg" alt="real world smmis" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smmis.jpg 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smmis-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smmis-768x549.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p>For Sir Manasseh Meyer International School (SMMIS), preparing students for the real world means giving them future ready skills as well as a <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/smmis-parent-review-caring-family-like-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe and secure start in life</a>. The school believes it’s essential to help young people develop emotional and social resilience, teach them language and positive communication skills, as well as <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/smmis-international-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technology and STEAM</a> to make them future-ready. The ability to communicate clearly and respectfully is a key skill; whereas knowledge in technology and STEAM teaches students to navigate the increasingly digitalised world safely and ethically. But most importantly, social and emotional resilience ensures students can take care of their own wellbeing and mental health.</p>
<p>SMMIS incorporates all these in its academic curriculum and co-curricular offerings. Students are taught future-ready skills and resilience through Personal, Social and Health Education lessons, Drama and Public Speaking classes, Makerspace and IT classes, and more. The wide array of After-School Activities provided, as well as local and overseas field trips also prepare students for a life beyond school. Teaching staff are trained to use Artificial Intelligence in the classroom ethically to equip students with technology skill sets. In line with its commitment to <em>Tikkun Olam</em> (repairing the world), SMMIS places strong emphasis on community service through Service Learning and its National Youth Achievement Award. Students gain lifelong skills and empathy by volunteering in the Student Council and running House activities.</p>

<h3>Overseas Family School</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-205809" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Resizing-11-1.jpg" alt="real world ofs" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Resizing-11-1.jpg 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Resizing-11-1-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Resizing-11-1-768x549.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p>The curriculum and programmes at Overseas Family School (OFS) are intentionally designed to strengthen 21st century competencies among its students. This includes teaching students critical and inventive thinking, as well as values like empathy and resilience. All these are integrated into the curriculum from kindergarten onwards.</p>
<p>Academic-wise, the <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/ofs-ib-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IB curriculum at OFS</a> is delivered with a strong focus on transferable skills like research, communication, critical thinking, collaboration, and reflection. For example: OFS is one of the few schools that provide students with the opportunity to conduct their Extended Essay in World Studies. This encourages students to investigate challenging global issues that cannot be adequately investigated within the confines of a single subject. Unique programmes such as chess and coding are included as a compulsory part of OFS&#8217; Elementary School curriculum. These programmes teach students to think strategically and boost their problem-solving skills. Aside from these, OFS’ Model United Nations and extensive Mother Tongue Programs nurtures an appreciation for multiculturalism and multilingualism – as essential aspect in our interconnected world.</p>
<p>Students at OFS also have the opportunity to engage in a wide array of <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/ofs-extracurricular-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extracurricular activities</a>. This facilitates the Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) component of the IB, as students can participate in activities like the Red Cross, The Ocean Project, and Riding for the Disabled. Students can also join special interest clubs like Law Academy, Medical Scholars, and the Psychology Club. These give students the chance to lead, collaborate, make a meaningful impact on their community, and explore future careers.</p>

If you don’t know where to start, be spoiled for choice with UOL Malls’ first ever U-CAMP Holiday Workshops that’s happening over this upcoming school holiday, with workshops for every personality and age group. More conveniently, the holiday workshops are held across all three of its malls: United Square, Velocity@Novena Square, and KINEX. So you get to choose one that’s nearer to you.</p>
<p>Read on to figure out which holiday workshop you think will suit your kid best…</p>
<h3>1. For the movers and shakers</h3>

</ul>
<h3>3. For the dreamers</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225388" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225388" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225388" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/UOL-Malls-U-Camp-Holiday-Workshops-7-900x643.jpg" alt="UOL Malls U-Camp Holiday Workshops 7" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/UOL-Malls-U-Camp-Holiday-Workshops-7-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/UOL-Malls-U-Camp-Holiday-Workshops-7-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/UOL-Malls-U-Camp-Holiday-Workshops-7.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225388" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Little Cook</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here’s a heads-up for all the aspiring artists and creative souls in our troop! There are workshops and classes dedicated to letting their creative juices flow.</p>
<h3>U-CAMP Holiday Workshops to check out:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>KINEX:</strong> Does your mini-me enjoy hands-on activities? Kids seven years and up will have fun painting their own sneakers in a class by MurcyArt Gallery from 30 May to 6 July. Otherwise, level up by encouraging your children five years and up to paint an A4 canvas together with Tree Art on various dates in June and July.<br />
Or, perhaps your little foodie has always dreamed of whipping up a feast in the kitchen? They can do so during Little Cook’s short and sweet cooking class from 30 May to 6 July, where they’ll learn how to cook delicious dishes designed specially for children. We love that this workshop is suitable for young ones aged two and above too!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>United Square:</strong> If your kiddos from nine to 10 years old have shown an interest in the written word, give them a taste of journalism with Aspire Hub Education on 11 June, where they can step into the shoes of a young journalist for two hours.<br />
On the other hand, Hua Language Centre&#8217;s approach of combining language lessons with craft activities on 16 and 18 June could be a great way to make learning more interactive and enjoyable, especially for younger learners.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. For the thinkers</h3>
<p>We’ve all been there: sometimes our children have an ‘a-ha!’ moment, or they surprise us with their analytical thinking. If your child can always find their way out of a pickle in a jiffy, they might be a strategist in the making – sign them up for a chess or coding session to challenge their thinking skills!</p>
<h4>U-CAMP Holiday Workshops to check out:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>United Square:</strong> Inspired by Queen’s Gambit, we’ve tried (and failed) to navigate our way through chess. Perhaps, your little ones will fare better? Give them — children aged six to 12 — a good headstart and foundation with Chess At Three’s beginner and advanced classes on 24 and 25 June.</li>
</ul>
<p>For beginners, coders between the ages of five and 11 can learn the ropes from Futurum Academy during an introduction to coding and robotics from 17 to 19 June.</p>
<figure id="attachment_225389" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225389" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225389" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/UOL-Malls-U-Camp-Holiday-Workshops-4-900x643.jpg" alt="UOL Malls U-Camp Holiday Workshops " width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/UOL-Malls-U-Camp-Holiday-Workshops-4-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/UOL-Malls-U-Camp-Holiday-Workshops-4-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/UOL-Malls-U-Camp-Holiday-Workshops-4.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225389" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: The Lab</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>KINEX:</strong> For the mini tech whizzes between the ages of seven and 12, they’ll absolutely love The Lab’s introduction to game design (specifically the Super Mario Platformer game) on 11, 12, and 13 June.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus: Parent-child workshops</h3>
<p>Want to make some great memories this school holiday? Sign up for a workshop that you can enjoy together with your child! Asterspring is hosting a fun skincare fundamentals class at United Square from 26 to 27 June. Kids can get started on caring for their skins, and parents will pick up some invaluable tips to incorporate into your daily routine. Each workshop is suitable for one parent and one child (from 11 years old), and will include a sweet $40 store credits for you to spend after.</p>

<p>Therapy provides a safe, non-judgmental space to explore thoughts and emotions, sometimes for the very first time. Even a single session can be meaningful, offering the chance to express what has been held in silence and make sense of what feels heavy or unclear. It allows people to reflect, feel heard, and begin to understand themselves in new ways. Whether someone is navigating stress, emotional pain, relationship challenges, or seeking clarity, therapy creates room for honest conversation and understanding one&#8217;s inner world.</p>
<p>This Father’s Day, Marissa Nasution is offering a free therapy session for dads: because dads need it too. Whether it is the mental load, parenting stress, emotional overwhelm, work stress, or just needing to get things off your chest, this can be the first step in sharing and understanding what you might be going through.</p>

<p>Ooooh, I am so excited for this! One of the most well-loved musicals of all time is returning to Singapore this May. Andrew Lloyd Webber&#8217;s remarkable production, The Phantom of the Opera, will be haunting the stage at Sands Theatre for a strictly limited season. This dark love story tells the tale of a mysterious masked figure (played in Singapore by South African theatre star <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jroxmouth/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Roxmouth</a>) who lurks beneath the Paris Opera House, exercising a reign of terror over all who inhabit it. He falls madly in love with a young soprano, Christine Daae (the lovely <a href="https://www.instagram.com/graceyroberts/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grace Roberts</a>) and devotes himself to nurturing her extraordinary talents. Stars Jonathan and Grace will be joined by a talented global cast of 37 performers from all over the world!</p>
<figure id="attachment_224740" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224740" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224740" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-900x643.jpg" alt="The Phantom of the Opera review" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224740" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>We caught the gala night of The Phantom of the Opera and even with a familiar plot, the show struck a different chord this time. It wasn’t just a captivating performance with beautiful vocals, it was also an expressive and emotionally rich portrayal of the Phantom and Christine. Our favourite parts were the renditions of “Think of Me” and “Music of the Night”, while we felt that “That’s All I Ask of You” was slightly rushed in its delivery. However, the show was still mesmerising, leaving us moved by its music and striking vocals, dramatic staging, and its timeless allure. This time, there are even stunning photo points perfect to snap up the memories of the night. For those sensitive to lights, do note that there are some strobing lights at the beginning of the show.</p>

<p>Deep issues facing our teens today are the theme of this acclaimed musical, packed with some of the biggest musical theatre songs of the last decade. The story follows Evan, an anxious high school kid who wants nothing more than to fit in. On his way to fitting in, he didn’t tell the whole truth, and now he must give up on a life he never dreamt he’d have. As events spiral and the truth comes out, Evan faces a reckoning with himself and everyone around him. We love that for this production, in the spirit of Dear Evan Hansen and its powerful message of connection, there&#8217;ll be a special seating category for single theatre goers. ‘You Are Not Alone’ is a dedicated section of 56 seats reserved exclusively for solo ticket holders. Coming to the theatre alone should feel just as welcoming and exciting as coming with a group. So take a seat, enjoy the show, and mingle with fellow theatre lovers when flying solo!</p>

The expedition ended with a simple BBQ setup (complete with chairs, a table, grill and stove) and we were ready to grill the food we brought with us. The package includes kayaks, BBQ equipment, packet drinks and instant noodles; so we just needed to bring a few more BBQ items of our own (we brought satay, prawns and some chicken drumlets!) and our guide Kaz did the rest! Our five-year-old loved the whole experience – KayakXtremeSports also offers fishing expeditions, trips to nearby floating restaurants, island hopping and more!</p>

<p>Selamat Hari Raya Haji! The <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/singapore-public-holidays-travel-planning-long-weekends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public holiday</a> is almost here (it falls on <strong>Saturday, 7 June</strong> this year) and with it comes an extra day of fun to have around <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/cultural-things-to-do-in-singapore-with-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Singapore with the kiddos</a>. Hurrah! We’ve been taking a look at what this Islamic festival means, where we can join in the celebrations (regardless of our own religion), and what’s on for families.</p>
<h2>All about Hari Raya Haji in Singapore</h2>
<h3>What is Hari Raya Haji?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_201448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-201448" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-201448" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hari-raya-haji-celebrations-singapore-mecca-900x643.jpg" alt="hari-raya-haji-celebrations-singapore-mecca" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hari-raya-haji-celebrations-singapore-mecca-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hari-raya-haji-celebrations-singapore-mecca-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hari-raya-haji-celebrations-singapore-mecca.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-201448" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Haydan As-soendawy via Pexels</figcaption></figure>
<p>The day falls on the 10th day of Zulhijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic calendar. It marks the end of the Hajj, a holy pilgrimage every Muslim is encouraged to make at least once in their lives (pictured up top). During the pilgrimage, Muslims have to perform several rituals and actions in Mecca, the holiest city in Islam. It is Saudi Arabia&#8217;s third most populated city, after Riyadh and Jeddah.</p>
<h3>The significance behind Hari Raya Haji</h3>
<p><strong>Hari Raya Haji</strong> (which means “great day of the hajj” in Malay), also known as <strong>Eid al-Adha</strong>, is an important festival where Muslims reflect on the story of God commanding Ibrahim to sacrifice his son, Ismail. Thankfully, no small children came to harm as God intervened by allowing Ibrahim to sacrifice a sheep instead.</p>
<h3>Marking the Hari Raya Haji date on the calendar</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225322" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225322" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/new-moon.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225322" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/new-moon-900x643.png" alt="new moon" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/new-moon-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/new-moon-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/new-moon.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225322" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Raiz Redwan</figcaption></figure>
<p>Wonder why Hari Raya Haji is not celebrated on a fixed date every year? That&#8217;s because, like all Muslim festivals, the date of Hari Raya Haji is chosen based on astronomical calculations that rely on the sighting of the new moon. In Singapore, the date of the festival is determined by <a href="https://www.muis.gov.sg/resources/media-releases/announcement-by-mufti-for-the-first-day-of-zulhijjah-1446h-and-date-of-hari-raya-aidiladha-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura</a> and is announced by the Mufti, or the highest-ranking Islamic scholar in Singapore, several days before.</p>
<h3>Fasting and Prayers during Hari Raya Haji</h3>
<figure id="attachment_201449" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-201449" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-201449" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hari-raya-haji-celebrations-singapore-prayers-900x643.jpg" alt="hari-raya-haji-celebrations-singapore-prayers" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hari-raya-haji-celebrations-singapore-prayers-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hari-raya-haji-celebrations-singapore-prayers-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hari-raya-haji-celebrations-singapore-prayers.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-201449" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: RDNE Stock project via Pexels</figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike Ramadan, where Muslims are required to fast from sunrise to sunset, fasting for Hari Raya Haji is optional. The fasting ritual is usually done on the eve of Hari Raya Haji and is called <strong>Wukuf</strong>. On the day of the festival, Muslims gather in mosques for congregational prayers, followed by the <strong>korban</strong> ritual.</p>
<h3>Korban, the Hari Raya Haji sacrificial ritual</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225323" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225323" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/korban-hari-raya-haji.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225323" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/korban-hari-raya-haji-900x643.png" alt="korban hari raya haji" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/korban-hari-raya-haji-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/korban-hari-raya-haji-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/korban-hari-raya-haji.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225323" class="wp-caption-text">Don&#8217;t worry kids, the sheep are not tortured for the Korban ritual. Image: wirestock via Freepik</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8216;Korban&#8217; is an important part of the festival and represents Prophet Ibrahim’s faith and trust in God. Typically, mosques around Singapore take part in the ritual where sheep or goats will be sacrificed during Korban. The animal is then cleaned and the meat is carved up and distributed. Just so you know, the animals are definitely not being tortured! In fact, their comfort and welfare are of utmost importance during the whole process. Islam&#8217;s slaughtering method ensures a quick and humane death to the animal.</p>
<p>This year, 52 mosques in Singapore will be offering overseas Korban for Muslims. The sheep are sacrificed, chilled and dispatched from places like Australia for the upcoming celebrations in Singapore. Looking to book your Korban? Click <a href="https://korban.ourmasjid.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Lessons to learn from Hari Raya Haji</h3>
<p>Sacrifice is a big theme in most Muslim celebrations and Hari Raya Haji highlights the importance of faith in God. It&#8217;s also a reminder that there are those around us that might need our help. This makes the act of donating and distributing the sacrificed meat to those who need it more than us an honourable one. As Hari Raya Aidiladha is more about spiritual needs than physical ones, the huge feasts and merrymaking of <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/hari-raya-aidilfitri-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hari Raya Aidilfitri</a> are not usually repeated. The food tables at the Muslim members of the HoneyKids team will still be laden, though! We love our traditional foods like ketupat, rendang, satay, and lontong, especially when they&#8217;re homemade. Mmm!</p>
<h2>What to do during Hari Raya Haji in Singapore</h2>
<h3>1. Visit Singapore&#8217;s most famous Mosque</h3>
<figure id="attachment_198164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-198164" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sultan-mosque-one-kampong-gelam.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-198164" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sultan-mosque-one-kampong-gelam-900x643.jpg" alt="Sultan Mosque | Mosques in Singapore" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sultan-mosque-one-kampong-gelam-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sultan-mosque-one-kampong-gelam-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sultan-mosque-one-kampong-gelam.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-198164" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: One Kampong Gelam</figcaption></figure>
<p>To really get a feel for the religion and culture, Sultan Mosque – also known as Masjid Sultan – in historic <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/kampong-glam-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kampong Glam</a> makes a great place to visit with the kids. Built in 1824 for Sultan Hussein Shah, the first sultan of Singapore, Sir Stamford Raffles originally gave $3,000 for the construction of a single-storey building with a double-tiered roof. Today, the mosque is a focal point for the Muslim community. For the full lowdown on this beautiful building, try a guided tour! Tours come in English, Malay, Chinese, or Japanese.</p>
<p>Night markets often spring up in the area, complete with food stalls whenever there&#8217;s an important festival happening. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget to check out the local &#8216;hood, too: <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/haji-lane-with-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haji Lane and Arab Street</a> make a great hang-out with kids.<br />

<h3>2. Spend the day at the museums</h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-197039 aligncenter" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/peranakan-museum-singapore-900x643.jpg" alt="peranakan-museum-singapore" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/peranakan-museum-singapore-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/peranakan-museum-singapore-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/peranakan-museum-singapore.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Take the time out to head to a museum! We find that a public holiday is the best time to visit, and there are tons of <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-kid-friendly-museums-exhibitions-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kid-friendly museums</a> in town to go to during Hari Raya Haji. Our favourites to visit with the kids? <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">National Gallery Singapore</a> and the Children’s Museum Singapore have awesome exhibits for kids. We also had a great time exploring the <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/honeykids-tries-a-day-at-singapore-art-museum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Singapore Art Museum at Tanjong Pagar Distripark </a>and the <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/peranakan-museum-singapore-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peranakan Museum</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Visit a goat farm</h3>
<figure id="attachment_154598" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154598" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-154598" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FC.HayDiaries.EDITED-115-900x643.jpg" alt="hey dairies baby goat" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FC.HayDiaries.EDITED-115-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FC.HayDiaries.EDITED-115-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/FC.HayDiaries.EDITED-115.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-154598" class="wp-caption-text">Take your cute kids to meet the cute kids at Hay Dairies.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Korban will not be taking place in Singapore again this year, the closest that you can get to see cows and goats this Hari Raya Haji are at the <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/farm-visits-in-singapore-with-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">farms</a> in Lim Chu Kang. Don&#8217;t worry, you won&#8217;t be witnessing any slaughtering over here! Just some a-meh-zing creatures that you can pat, take photos with, and then buy some milk from after your trip.<br />

We love that it blends education, art, music and play to deepen parent-child connections, and to help everyone express their emotions (while having a whole lot of fun). There are three zones with six interactive activities, including &#8216;Who Am I?&#8217; which encourages the kids to use stamps and crafting to create a cute self portrait. There are shapes and puzzles to play with on a projector, a spinning hong bowl, and soft play. There&#8217;s also a party room with dance music for the kids to really get into the groove!</p>

<p>We are so excited for this! One of our favourite kids events in Singapore is returning this weekend, and entry is absolutely free! This year, the GBTB Children’s Festival will feature Disney’s Stitch (from Lilo &amp; Stitch) for the first time! This is a whole Stitch-themed outdoor festival, with large-scale installations and fun play areas. We can’t wait to ‘surf’ down an almost 7-metre tall slide called The Great ‘Ohana Wave! In the Forest of Belonging, kiddos navigate an inflatable forest to uncover hidden messages.</p>
<p>In a nod to Stitch’s extraterrestrial origins, little ones can embark on a Space Adventure. Get in on the fun and race swing cars to power up light beams and complete a space mission! The beachside fun of the story is brought to life with Stitch’s Mischief Makers. Here, kids can nurture creativity and sensory awareness through playing with kinetic sand. The Children’s Festival aims to teach kids ‘the importance of friendship and family, while learning to embrace and accept themselves for who they are.’ Mark your diary! The Festival is just in time for the live-action reimagining of Disney’s Lilo &amp; Stitch movie, which opens in cinemas on May 22.</p>
<p><strong>Best bit:</strong> Gardens by the Bay Children’s Festival featuring Lilo &amp; Stitch has no admission charge, and most activities are free.

<p>Preloved kidswear online store Retykle is back with a pop-up at Plaza Singapura and we checked it out! We spotted brands like Dior, Michael Kors, Bonpoint, Ralph Lauren and more at up to 90% off retail price. There’s a pretty good selection of ‘brand new with tags’ to ‘like new’ and ‘lightly/gently used’ clothing and shoes for kids age 0 – 14 years old. We highly recommend checking out the winter wear section for the chance to snag high quality ski suits and jackets at great deals (especially since kids outgrow these expensive clothes so quickly!). A majority of the inventory comes from Singapore-based sellers and parents so there’s lots of options for our tropical weather. Everything is meticulously quality checked at Retykle’s nearby warehouse before it hits the online and physical store, and stocks are refreshed at the Plaza Singapura pop-up weekly. Prices range from $10 to about $200. <a title="" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGweWL8TdL6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-original-title="">Watch our reel for a closer look!</a></p>

<p>You&#8217;ve heard of <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/things-to-do-kids-childrens-day-celebrate-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Children&#8217;s Day</a> (we even have a <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/international-school-holidays-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public holiday</a> for it!) But have you head of Global Day of Parents? There&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day, and Father&#8217;s Day, but this one is for both of us &#8211; yes, it&#8217;s a day just for parents! On <strong>1 June, 2025</strong>, families around the world will observe the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/parents-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Nations Global Day of Parents.</a> This is a day dedicated to recognising the selfless commitment we make as parents and caregivers in nurturing and protecting our children. It&#8217;s the most important, rewarding, exhausting job we&#8217;ll ever have, and the UN General Assembly knows this as well. Established in 2012, Global Parents Day is an acknowledgment of the pivotal role parents play in shaping the future of their children and, by extension, society as a whole.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tough gig, that we can&#8217;t really train for, but we&#8217;re doing it! We see you, we are you, and we&#8217;re all in this together. Here are some ways to take a moment and honour your role as a parent, while starting some beautiful family traditions you just might want to take part in every year!</p>
<h2>What is Global Day of Parents? The origin story</h2>
<figure id="attachment_222682" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-222682" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-222682" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/kids-baju-kurung-maqayla-family-set-boys-900x643.jpeg" alt="kids baju kurung maqayla family set boys" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/kids-baju-kurung-maqayla-family-set-boys-900x643.jpeg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/kids-baju-kurung-maqayla-family-set-boys-768x549.jpeg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/kids-baju-kurung-maqayla-family-set-boys.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-222682" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Maqayla</figcaption></figure>
<p>The origins of the Global Day of Parents trace back to the 1980&#8217;s. The UN began focusing on family-related issues, recognising the significant impact of parents on their children&#8217;s development, which was in turn shaping society. In 1989, the General Assembly declared 1994 as the International Year of the Family, to bring focus to the importance the family unit plays in our world. In 1993, the UN designated 15 May as the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/international-day-of-families" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Day of Families</a>. Building upon this foundation, 1 June was officially proclaimed as the Global Day of Parents in 2012, aiming to honour parents worldwide for their unwavering dedication and sacrifices (and as we know, there are many!)</p>
<h2>Reflecting on the role of parents in Singapore and globally</h2>
<p>The Global Day of Parents serves as a reminder of the immense responsibility and privilege of parenthood, whether you are a parent yourself or not. It encourages societies as a whole to recognise the challenges parents face and to advocate for policies that support families. This includes important considerations such as <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/singapore-budget-families-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parental leave</a>, affordable childcare, and flexible working arrangements.</p>
<p>In Singapore, <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/finding-work-life-balance-shift-work-mum-parent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work-life balance</a> is a rising priority. By celebrating the Global Day of Parents, families can reaffirm their commitment to nurturing the next generation in a loving and supportive environment. It&#8217;s also a great reminder of how much work we still need to do as a nation and a society to create a supportive environment for families, and parents.</p>
<h2>The 2025 Theme: &#8216;The Promise of Playful Parenting&#8217;</h2>
<figure id="attachment_194882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-194882" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-194882" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Family-bike-ride-singapore-900x643.png" alt="Family bike ride singapore" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Family-bike-ride-singapore-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Family-bike-ride-singapore-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Family-bike-ride-singapore.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-194882" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>
<p>The theme for the 2025 Global Day of Parents is &#8216;The Promise of Playful Parenting.&#8217; This theme was chosen to highlight the <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/childrens-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">importance of play</a> in our kiddo&#8217;s development. But play isn&#8217;t just for the kids! As parents, it&#8217;s a great reminder that we don&#8217;t always have to be the &#8216;bad cop&#8217;, and playful interaction with our kids can foster learning, creativity, and emotional bonding.</p>
<h2>How to celebrate Global Day of Parents in Singapore as a family: our favourite heart-bursting ideas</h2>
<p>In Singapore, where family values are deeply ingrained in the culture, the Global Day of Parents offers an opportunity to strengthen our family bonds and create lasting memories. Here are some ideas for families to celebrate this special day:</p>
<h3>1. Create a Family Time Capsule</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225250" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225250" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225250" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Time-capsule-family-photos-Global-Day-of-Parents-Singapore-tradition-900x643.png" alt="Time capsule family photos Global Day of Parents Singapore tradition" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Time-capsule-family-photos-Global-Day-of-Parents-Singapore-tradition-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Time-capsule-family-photos-Global-Day-of-Parents-Singapore-tradition-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Time-capsule-family-photos-Global-Day-of-Parents-Singapore-tradition.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225250" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Rodolfo Clix</figcaption></figure>
<p>I absolutely love this idea! It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always wanted to do with my own family, and never got around to. Why not make today the day? Collect mementos such as photographs, letters, and small keepsakes that represent your family. An old favourite toy from the kiddos, sentimental drawings, or have everyone write their own letter to each other saying three things they love and admire about that person.</p>
<p>Seal the goodies in a box as a &#8216;time capsule&#8217;, to be opened on a future date &#8211; perhaps next year&#8217;s Global Day of Parents? This could be a brand new family tradition in the making, that could make Global Day of Parents super meaningful every year, while building a collection of mementos from your family&#8217;s history.</p>
<h3>2. It&#8217;s picnic time! Grab some snacks and dine alfresco for some memorable family time</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225247" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225247" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Picnic-with-kids-Singapore-family-Global-Parents-Day-900x643.png" alt="Picnic with kids Singapore family Global Parents Day" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Picnic-with-kids-Singapore-family-Global-Parents-Day-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Picnic-with-kids-Singapore-family-Global-Parents-Day-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Picnic-with-kids-Singapore-family-Global-Parents-Day.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225247" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Kampus Studio via Pexels</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gather the family for a picnic at one of <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-parks-for-kids-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Singapore&#8217;s beautiful parks</a>, such as the Botanic Gardens, East Coast Park or Gardens by the Bay. Pack a basket with everyone&#8217;s favourite snacks, bring along some outdoor games, and enjoy quality time together amidst nature. You could also cool off at a <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-water-parks-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water park</a>, always a great way to bring on the giggles!</p>
<h3>3. Go on theme, and try some playful parenting</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224927" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224927" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224927" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Curiosity-Cove-Asian-Civilisations-Museum-Things-to-do-with-kids-this-weekend-900x643.png" alt="Curiosity Cove Asian Civilisations Museum Things to do with kids this weekend" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Curiosity-Cove-Asian-Civilisations-Museum-Things-to-do-with-kids-this-weekend-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Curiosity-Cove-Asian-Civilisations-Museum-Things-to-do-with-kids-this-weekend-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Curiosity-Cove-Asian-Civilisations-Museum-Things-to-do-with-kids-this-weekend.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224927" class="wp-caption-text">Asian Civilisations Museum.

<p>Embrace the theme of &#8220;The Promise of Playful Parenting&#8221; by participating in activities that promote fun and learning. Visit interactive museums like the <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/gallery-childrens-biennale-2025-tomorrow-well-be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Children&#8217;s Biennale</a> at the National Gallery or the brand new ACM &amp; ME family friendly space at Asian Civilisations Museum. You could also organise a family game day at home with board games and creative challenges.</p>
<h3>4. Volunteer together</h3>

Participate in local initiatives that support children and families. Ideas could include organising a beach clean up, a charity drive or assisting at community events. This not only strengthens family bonds but also contributes to the well-being of the wider community &#8211; and ups the feel good factor!</p>
<h3>5. Share your family stories and traditions with your kids</h3>
<p>Spend time sharing family stories. The kids may have heard them a thousand times, but family lore is only preserved when it&#8217;s shared. Take some time to recount your own childhood memories. Talk about your family&#8217;s culture, and upcoming special days. What makes your family special? What traditions do you have that can be passed down through generations, that you hope your kids will carry on? You&#8217;ll be surprised how discussions like these can bring you closer together (cue the tears!)</p>
<h3>Join the Conversation</h3>
<p>As we celebrate the Global Day of Parents, let&#8217;s take a moment. Let&#8217;s appreciate the parents in our lives and reflect on the importance of family in shaping our communities. Share your thoughts and celebrations using the hashtag #GlobalDayOfParents and join the global movement in honouring parenthood.</p>
<p><strong>From all of us at HoneyKids, you&#8217;re awesome!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://honeykidsasia.com/lgbtq-resources-parents-singapore/">Pride Month 2025: LGBTQ+ resources for parents in Singapore</a></p>
<p>Here at HoneyKids, we’re proud to celebrate diversity and inclusion in different ways, like by starting a <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/how-to-talk-to-kids-about-racism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conversation about race with our kids</a>, or by curling up with a book that teaches them the <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/childrens-books-celebrate-diversity-gender-race-sexuality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">importance of diversity</a>. After all, Pride Month is a chance to celebrate all-inclusive love and a time for allies to support members of the LGBTQ+ community. If you’re a parent of a queer child and are trying to deeper understand your child, here are some LGBTQ+ resources in Singapore for parents to check out.</p>
<h2>LGBTQ+ resources for parents in Singapore</h2>
<h3>1. Oogachaga</h3>
<figure id="attachment_213203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-213203" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-213203" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/oogachaga-pride-month-lgbtq-singapore.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/oogachaga-pride-month-lgbtq-singapore.jpg 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/oogachaga-pride-month-lgbtq-singapore-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/oogachaga-pride-month-lgbtq-singapore-768x549.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-213203" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Oogachaga</figcaption></figure>
<p>If your child has recently come out to you, you may find it hard to understand what they’re going through and are looking for ways to help them. Chances are, they might not want to talk about this to you because they’re still figuring themselves out. Besides being loving and accepting in their coming out, check out <a href="https://oogachaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Oogachaga</a> – Singapore’s most established LGBTQ+ community, a non-profit organisation for individuals, couples, and families.</p>
<p>Oogachaga not only has <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/counselling-therapy-children-families-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counselling and support services</a> for your LGBTQ+ child but also dedicated hotline and Whatsapp numbers you can contact. Alternatively, you can also fix an appointment with a member of its team of professional counsellors who work with LGBTQ+ individuals, couples and families, and family members of those who identify as LGBTQ+.</p>
<p>Looking for other resources? <a href="https://www.congregaytion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Congregaytion</a> is an LGBTQ+ community resource portal started by the folks from Oogachaga. It has articles, videos and other publications for parents and those in the community.</p>
<p><em>What parents say: “When my son came out, I felt completely lost. Oogachaga helped me understand him better, and gave us both the confidence to move forward.” – Parent, anonymous (shared via Oogachaga’s support forum)</em></p>
<h3>2. Pink Dot SG</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most well-known organisation on the list, <a href="https://pinkdot.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Pink Dot SG</a> is a non-profit organisation for the LGBTQ+ community in Singapore. You can keep up with LGBTQ+ news in the country or volunteer at its annual Pink Dot event at Hong Lim Park. Though foreigners are unable to attend Pink Dot, you can support the movement by contributing in whichever way you can.</p>
<p><em>What the organisers say: “To me, Pink Dot will exist as long as discrimination against the LGBTQ community exists. As we can see today, repeal was a significant milestone, but LGBTQ individuals and their families continue to be marginalised in so many different ways. As long as that remains true, Pink Dot will always take place.” &#8211; Clement Tan, Pink Dot organiser.</em></p>
<h3>3. Proud Parents SG</h3>
<p>LGBTQ+ parents can turn to <a href="https://proudparents.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Proud Parents SG.</a> It operates as a support group for LGBTQ+ parents with children and also provides support and resources for LGBTQ+ people who are looking to start a family.</p>
<p><em>What the organisers say: &#8220;Here’s to a Singapore that is kinder to LGBTQ+ individuals, families &amp; our broader community in the future.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>4. Young OUT Here</h3>
<figure id="attachment_213204" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-213204" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-213204" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/young-out-here-pride-month-lgbtq-singapore.jpg" alt="young out here pride month lgbtq singapore" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/young-out-here-pride-month-lgbtq-singapore.jpg 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/young-out-here-pride-month-lgbtq-singapore-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/young-out-here-pride-month-lgbtq-singapore-768x549.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-213204" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Young OUT Here</figcaption></figure>

<p><em>From the Young OUT Here Facebook forum: &#8220;It is about chosen, found family; and in Singapore, we are celebrating local houses.&#8221; &#8211; Irzie KasiCunt &amp; Jess 007</em></p>
<h3>5. Transgender SG</h3>
<p>An education and resource portal for transgender persons in Singapore, <a href="https://transgendersg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Transgender SG</a> is a great web resource for parents of transgender children to consult. Parents can learn more about the issues faced by transgenders during transitioning, and where to get help for issues such as hormone therapy, surgeries, voice training, gender dysmorphia and more within Singapore. There are also additional LGBTQ+ resources, support groups and organisations that you can reach out to.</p>
<p><em>What the organisers say: &#8220;Whether you are transgender yourself, have a loved one who just came out, are a healthcare provider or simply wish to find out more about transgender issues in Singapore, we hope that here you will find useful information, support, and the assurance that you are not alone.&#8221; &#8211; Transgender SG website</em></p>
<h3>6. Pelangi Pride Centre</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-160035" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LGBT-books-to-read-this-Pride-Month-HoneyKids-9-900x643.jpeg" alt="" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LGBT-books-to-read-this-Pride-Month-HoneyKids-9-900x643.jpeg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LGBT-books-to-read-this-Pride-Month-HoneyKids-9-768x549.jpeg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LGBT-books-to-read-this-Pride-Month-HoneyKids-9.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>

Check out <a href="http://www.pelangipridecentre.org/lib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Pelangi Pride Centre</a>, an LGBTQ+ community and resource centre. It has a library of fiction and non-fiction titles that you can borrow in person, and parents can volunteer at the library if they wish to do so.</p>
<h3>7. Sayoni</h3>
<p>Founded by six women from diverse backgrounds in 2006, <a href="https://www.sayoni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Sayoni</a> aims to empower queer women, including lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women. The Singapore-based, volunteer-led organisation believes everyone has a part to play in improving the lives of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

<h3>8. The T Project</h3>
<figure style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium" src="https://static.thehoneycombers.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/lgbtq-organisations-in-singapore-The-T-Project-900x643.png" width="900" height="643"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photography: The T Project via Facebook</figcaption></figure>
<p>An independent community initiative that&#8217;s set up by two sisters, <a href="https://www.thetprojectsg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The T Project</a> is Singapore&#8217;s first (and only) social service that caters to the transgender community. It runs a shelter as a temporary haven for those who are homeless. The Alicia Community Centre was set up in 2018 as a safe space for transgender and gender non-binary individuals. On top of that, it also has a library and a museum.</p>
<p><em>What the organisers say: &#8220;We support our community through outreach and advocacy. Founded by June Chua and her late sister Alicia Chua in 2014, The T Project is the first trans-led social service for the transgender community in Singapore.&#8221; &#8211; The T Project website</em></p>
<h3>9. Same But Different</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a helpful resource that parents can refer to for free and easily understandable legal advice on issues faced by the LGBTQ+ community in Singapore. A volunteer-run non-profit project, <a href="https://www.samebutdifferent.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Same But Different</a> also provides a directory of LGBTQ-friendly lawyers. You can also download a free legal guidebook that answers families frequently ask. Topics covered in the book include marriage and divorce, wills and inheritance, children, and more.</p>
<p><em>What the organisers say: &#8220;Our vision is for a Singapore where LGBTQ people lead healthy, whole and fulfilling lives. We work towards our vision by creating resources to help the LGBTQ community in Singapore navigate legal and institutional challenges. We also conduct research to understand the issues and challenges that LGBTQ people in Singapore face and raise awareness among the public.&#8221; &#8211; Same but Different website</em></p>
<h3>10. Prident</h3>
<p>This is probably a little too ahead for your child, but it&#8217;s always good to plan ahead. <a href="https://prident.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Prident</a> aims to provide advice on matters such as financial services and personal development. This collective&#8217;s made up of professionals, so you can be assured that everything you&#8217;re receiving is sound.</p>
<p><em>What the organisers say: &#8220;We are a professional collective looking to empower Singapore&#8217;s LGBTQ+ community with financial wisdom.&#8221; &#8211; Prident.co website</em></p>
<h3>11. SAFE</h3>
<p>Support, affirm, and empower LGBTQ+ friends and family members is the name of the game from the folks at <a href="http://safesingapore.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SAFE</a>. You’ll find information to understand your loved ones better, FAQs on sexuality, sexual orientation, homophobia and more. Specifically, it has an FAQ page for parents of LGBTQ+ persons which you may find helpful, too.</p>
<p><em>What the organisers say: &#8220;We are inviting you to share stories of real, lived experiences of different types of families in Singapore, in particular families that comprise members of the LGBTQ+ community. We hope to publish these stories in the near future.&#8221; &#8211; SAFE Singapore website</em></p>
<h2>Bonus LGBTQ+ resources for parents in Singapore</h2>
<h3>12. <em>Always My Child</em> by Kevin Jennings, with Pat Shapiro</h3>
<p>Sometimes, as parents, it&#8217;s easier for us to understand our kids&#8217; behaviours by reading a book. Written by Kevin Jennings and Pat Shapiro, <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7432-2649-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><em>Always My Child</em></a> has real-life stories, scientific research and practical advice to guide parents in understanding their LGBTQ+ children better.  The book also consists of sample conversations that may help facilitate an open channel for communication with your child and has topic-specific chapters to help.</p>
<h3>13. My Kid is Gay</h3>
<p>Despite being based in the United States, <a href="https://www.mykidisgay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">My Kid Is Gay</a> is a fantastic resource for parents to tap into so that families can read to help understand their LGBTQ+ kids. After all, isn&#8217;t that what we want to do? It also has specific articles that deal with <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/bullying-tips-how-to-help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bullying</a>, religion, <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/how-to-take-care-of-your-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health</a> and more to help your child navigate any problems they might be having since coming out, and how you can help as a parent.</p>
<h3>14. Counselling</h3>
<p>Wellness services like <a href="https://www.sofia.com.sg/lgbtq-counselling-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sofia</a> offer counselling to learn how to support LGBTQ+ children if you want to go the extra mile. It&#8217;s also a great place for your kids who have come out to learn more about themselves and how to deal with discrimination they might experience or just be a safe space for them to ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Pride Month!</strong></p>

<p>Free admission for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents; $25 for Foreigners</p>
<p>Music, craft, and the ideals of the Chinese literati converge in a new multi-sensory exhibition opening in the Scholars Gallery of the Asian Civilisations Museum, Singapore (ACM). The first major refresh to the gallery since 2015, the exhibition examines the significance of the qin 琴, later known as the guqin 古琴 (Chinese zither), in Chinese culture, where it has been played for over two thousand years.</p>
<p>Visitors will be able to appreciate the artistry of the qin through diverse objects dating from the Han dynasty (206 BC–AD 220) to today, including ancient instruments, bronzes, paintings, ceramics, rare books, and furniture. As part of the museum’s commitment to innovation, the exhibition features a dedicated space within the gallery to create opportunities for new and meaningful connections between art and audiences. Serving as a space for performance and reflection, visitors will be able to immerse themselves in the contemplative tranquillity of literati culture, complemented by a tactile digital interactive featuring an actual qin. Highlights include a series of recordings by renowned qin master Dr Kee Chee Koon, and a video presentation by master craftsman Ning Qunhui that reveals how the unique voice of each instrument is created.</p>
<p>As visitors uncover the unique voices of the qin, they are invited to reflect on the enduring role of music in fostering mindfulness and artistic appreciation.</p>

Based on a the criterion of humour, teamwork, and creativity, the panel of children selected from programmes they were pitched.

<p>In a nod to Stitch’s extraterrestrial origins, little ones can embark on a Space Adventure, where they race swing cars to power up light beams and complete their mission. The beachside fun of the story is brought to life with Stitch’s Mischief Makers, where children can nurture creativity and sensory awareness through playing with kinetic sand.  An experience for the whole family, Children’s Festival &#8216;hopes for children to discover friendship and family, while learning to embrace and accept themselves for who they are.&#8217;  Pssst&#8230; Mark you diary! Get ready for the live-action reimagining of Disney’s Lilo &amp; Stitch movie, which is now in cinemas.</p>

As you traipse through the narrow cobblestone streets of a charming Italian town, more than 10,000 lilies of over 50 varieties add pretty splashes of colour and perfume the air with their sweet scents.

<p>Are you ready to send your child to preschool? On top of it being a nerve-wracking time for everyone involved, it can get really overwhelming with all the choices out there. To make the school selection process even more difficult, preschool curriculums can be so different from each other! Some have mixed-age groups while some are play-based — where to start?! If you need help, you&#8217;re in luck. We&#8217;ve consulted experts from some of the top international schools in Singapore to get the lowdown on how to choose a preschool curriculum for your kids. Here&#8217;s what they had to say&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">How to choose the right preschool curriculum in Singapore</h2>
<h3>Is a strong home-school relationship what you&#8217;re looking for?</h3>
<h4><strong>&#8211; <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/nexus-international-school-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus International School (Singapore)</a></strong></h4>
<figure id="attachment_220954" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-220954" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-220954" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Resizing4.jpg" alt="preschool curriculum nexus" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Resizing4.jpg 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Resizing4-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Resizing4-768x549.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-220954" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Nexus International School (Singapore)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Community plays an important role in a child’s early years of education. When choosing a preschool curriculum, you may want to look for one that seeks to establish strong home-school relationships. Nexus International School’s (Singapore) Early Years programme does this with a play-based curriculum and intentionally fosters a sense of belonging within its community.</p>
<p><strong>What do kids learn? To be confident and independent.</strong></p>
<p>Nexus’ approach ensures that learning not only happens in school, but at home as well. Having a strong sense of belonging within its classroom helps children feel safe, valued, and supported. Coupled with its play-based curriculum that prioritises learner agency, children feel confident to explore their interests under their teachers’ guidance. Every aspect of the Early Years programme – from the classroom to learning activities – is intentionally designed to spark curiosity that connect to key concepts and ideas. As children navigate their spaces and take charge of their learning, they develop vital soft skills like responsibility, independence, and confidence to become resilient individuals.</p>
<h3>Is a welcoming learning environment important for your child?</h3>
<h4>&#8211; <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/singapore-american-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Singapore American School</a></h4>
<figure id="attachment_170972" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170972" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-170972 size-medium" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Singapore-American-School-900x643.jpg" alt="Singapore American School" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Singapore-American-School-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Singapore-American-School-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Singapore-American-School.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-170972" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Singapore American School</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s a good reason why the Singapore American School’s (SAS) Early Learning Centre calls itself “the happiest place on the little red dot”. Besides respecting the child as a capable, curious, and competent learner who can express themselves in multiple creative ways, SAS provides a fun and effective physical space for them to learn and grow. Inspired by the Reggio Emilia philosophy, the preschool environment is intentional, flexible, and reflective.</p>
<p><strong>What do kids learn? To collaborate and to wonder.</strong></p>
<p>With an effective Reggio-inspired space like SAS’ Early Learning Centre, your child will be empowered to form relationships with their peers, communicate and collaborate, as well as feeling comfortable to explore and learn from their surroundings. There are also ample resources and tools for your child to express themselves with, be it in the form of a painting, music, or dancing. The centre’s daily schedule is flexible as well, which allows time for your child to be curious, play, wonder, and learn all within the same day!</p>

<figure id="attachment_225205" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225205" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225205" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Preschool-curriculum-Dover-Court-International-School-900x643.jpg" alt="Preschool curriculum Dover Court International School" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Preschool-curriculum-Dover-Court-International-School-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Preschool-curriculum-Dover-Court-International-School-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Preschool-curriculum-Dover-Court-International-School.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225205" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Dover Court International School (DCIS)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a parent, we want to feel involved in every part of our little ones’ lives. Trust us, we feel you! There’s nothing better than a preschool that prioritises teacher-student communication, especially one that goes out of its way to welcome parents into the community. Indeed, at Dover Court International School (DCIS), learning is seen as a shared journey between students, families, and educators.</p>
<p><strong>What do kids learn? To be curious and resilient.</strong></p>
<p>Putting the children first, the preschool uses both the UK Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework and Reggio Emilia approach – where play holds a pivotal role in learning. This play is child-initiated, giving children the autonomy to take ownership of their own learning. Curiosity is key, and the school nurtures that with the use of open-ended materials and dedicated play spaces. On top of building emotional resilience, we especially love how DCIS recognises that each child is different by allowing them to move independently at their own pace.</p>
<h3>Is play-based learning important to you?</h3>

<p>Play comes naturally to children, and it’s also one of the ways in which they learn about the world around them. You’d be surprised how kids learn about the concept of weight through a session at the sandpit, or the concept of safety at kitchen pretend play! It’s also through play that children develop their gross and fine motor skills. When it comes to play-based learning, Little Paddington Preschool is an expert. The preschool combines both play-based and hands-on learning approaches to encourage children to follow their natural curiosity. Creative play equipment, inspiring outdoor spaces, as well as specialist ateliers are available on campus to engage children and let them explore.</p>
<p><strong>What do kids learn? To ask questions, discover, and engage.</strong></p>
<p>The focus of Little Paddington’s play-based and hands-on learning is on exploration, acquisition of content, skills, and concepts. Children learn language, numeracy, science, creative arts, and physical development through hands-on project works and dramatic play. They also develop confidence, teamwork skills, and independence through these integrated learning experiences. Play is also vital in Little Paddington’s preparation for primary programme. Structured activities and activity sheets help children master the required skills in reading, writing, Math, and Mandarin to thrive in primary school and beyond.</p>

<figure id="attachment_188152" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188152" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-188152 size-medium" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Resizing-1-3-900x643.jpg" alt="tanglin trust school infant school" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Resizing-1-3-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Resizing-1-3-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Resizing-1-3.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-188152" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Tanglin Trust School</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tanglin Trust School’s Nursery is the first in Asia to achieve the Curiosity Approach Accreditation. It embeds a culture of curiosity in the learning environment, taking inspiration from Reggio, Steiner, Te Whariki and Montessori approaches. &#8220;Children are thrilled to come to school every day, looking forward to opportunities that nurture inquisitive minds, capture imaginations, and ensure that the innate characteristics of children – curiosity, awe and wonder – flourish,&#8221; a representative from Tanglin Infant School explained.</p>
<p><strong>What do kids learn? To love learning.</strong></p>
<p>From an early age, the children at Tanglin are nurtured in the prime areas of learning, focusing on communication and language, personal and social skills, and physical development. &#8220;Through this, children are given a solid foundation for every other aspect in the preschool curriculum,&#8221; says the rep. &#8220;This really helps them thrive and learn to be independent, become confident and treat every challenge as an adventure.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Want a preschool or kindergarten with small class sizes?</h3>
<h4>&#8211; <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/international-community-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Community School (Singapore)</a></h4>
<figure id="attachment_165768" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165768" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-165768 size-medium" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ICS-900x643.jpg" alt="How to pick the right preschool curriculum in Singapore" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ICS-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ICS-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ICS.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-165768" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: International Community School (Singapore)</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;Compared to other large international schools, we have small sizes so we&#8217;re able to better personalise the learning experiences for each student. We greet all of our students by name from day one and give them opportunities to talk about their days,&#8221; a Junior Kindergarten teacher at International Community School (Singapore) said. The school also encourages smaller groups of students to work together based on their abilities, so the teachers can focus on the group&#8217;s strengths. Each student creates their own goals and family projects are also encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>What do kids learn? Open-ended fun.</strong></p>
<p>At ICS, kids can get involved with hands-on activities. &#8220;Pre-Covid, we did a lot of baking and cooking, but we still focused on allowing students the opportunity to connect their learning and play with physical objects, like painting,&#8221; an ICS teacher eplained. &#8220;We give students lots of open-ended creating time for them to expand their creativity and try new things.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Do you prefer a child-centred approach?</h3>
<h4>&#8211; <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/north-london-collegiate-school-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North London Collegiate School (Singapore)</a></h4>
<figure id="attachment_165767" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165767" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-165767 size-medium" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NLCS_24820_0704-900x643.jpg" alt="How to pick the right preschool curriculum in Singapore" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NLCS_24820_0704-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NLCS_24820_0704-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NLCS_24820_0704.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-165767" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: North London Collegiate School (Singapore)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At North London Collegiate School (Singapore), every child is considered unique. &#8220;We take the time to get to know every individual child and work in partnership with parents. We support each child in ‘running their own race’ offering a bespoke Early Years curriculum that focuses on each individual child’s needs,&#8221; the Head of Junior School at NLCS (Singapore) said. Worried that your child won&#8217;t be getting enough academics? NLCS (Singapore) is committed to providing an academically ambitious preschool curriculum that includes focused daily English and Maths lessons from the earliest stages of learning onwards.</p>
<p><strong>What do kids learn? To be challenged.</strong></p>
<p>Although the youngest students at NLCS (Singapore) learn through play, they still understand that there are expectations. &#8220;They will be continually challenged in their learning as we provide a ‘floors but no ceilings’ approach. There is also a strong emphasis on trans-disciplinary learning. This allows children to make links across the curriculum and to discover their own interests in an atmosphere which encourages independence, personal responsibility and care for others,&#8221; a teacher from NLCS (Singapore) explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://honeykidsasia.com/real-reviews-honeykids-singapore/">Real reviews: Things we&#8217;re loving in Singapore right now</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that we have some of the best jobs in Singapore. Not only do we offer our <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/?s=find+an+expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advice</a> and explore the latest new <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/things-to-do-with-kids-this-weekend-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">things to do</a> before they&#8217;ve even opened, we also get to test and review new products. We often get sent merch and items to try, with no obligation to post about them. Here are some of the things we&#8217;ve been loving lately, and our honest thoughts on why we love it (and why we think you will too..)</p>
<h3>1. Raising my daughter while realising my dreams &#8211; I&#8217;m building a business that I hope can nurture and support other families</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225197" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225197" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225197" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ananya-Pandit-Sparkanauts-Eat-Crave-Grub-Launchpad-900x643.png" alt="Ananya Pandit, Sparkanauts Eat Crave Grub Launchpad" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ananya-Pandit-Sparkanauts-Eat-Crave-Grub-Launchpad-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ananya-Pandit-Sparkanauts-Eat-Crave-Grub-Launchpad-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ananya-Pandit-Sparkanauts-Eat-Crave-Grub-Launchpad.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225197" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Ananya Pandit</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a mum and entrepreneur, one thing that’s been sparking joy for me lately is my own early childhood enrichment centre, Sparkanauts. Building a space that nurtures young minds while raising my own toddler has been deeply fulfilling. My little one is growing up right there—between classes, storytime, and planning sessions. It’s not about balancing work and life anymore, but integrating the two in a way that feels natural and meaningful. Watching children grow, laugh, and learn every day gives me a sense of purpose and light I didn’t expect. In many ways, Sparkanauts has been a gift to my own mental health—and I’m proud of that.<br />

<h3>2. Peaceful pastimes &#8211; crafty hobbies that relax the mind</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225198" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225198" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Launchpad-Natalia-900x643.png" alt="" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Launchpad-Natalia-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Launchpad-Natalia-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Launchpad-Natalia.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225198" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Natalia Moskaleva</figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve realised the importance of slowing down and refreshing our minds regularly. As a workaholic, I’ve found meditation in practical ways that I truly enjoy. I&#8217;ve recently taken up the art of flower arranging. A Saturday morning trip to the flower market, selecting blooms, and creating bouquets for home and friends is a meditative process. One day, in my 50s, I hope to turn this into a business!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also discovered a talent for bag restoration, repairing a worn-out bag was an unexpected meditation journey for me. Doing the physical work, seeing the original beauty come to life, and reinstating order from chaos &#8211; this was a deeply satisfying process, with an excellent practical result. Lastly, I&#8217;ve rediscovered a love of ballet dancing. Whether in class or at home with an online instructor, ballet combines music and movement, offering a step-by-step path to unattainable yet inspiring perfection.<br />

<h3>3. Trying new things: Kriti loves street jazz dancing</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225199" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225199" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kriti-Gupta-Nimbu-Launchpad-Street-jazz-Singapore-things-we-love-real-reviews-900x643.png" alt="" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kriti-Gupta-Nimbu-Launchpad-Street-jazz-Singapore-things-we-love-real-reviews-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kriti-Gupta-Nimbu-Launchpad-Street-jazz-Singapore-things-we-love-real-reviews-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kriti-Gupta-Nimbu-Launchpad-Street-jazz-Singapore-things-we-love-real-reviews.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225199" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Kriti Gupta</figcaption></figure>
<p>Lately, what’s been unapologetically sparking joy for me? Street jazz dancing. It’s one hour a week where I’m not a mom, a founder, or juggling a to-do list — just a woman moving to music, feeling free and alive. I started it on a whim, and now it’s my weekly therapy. I leave every class with a huge smile, sore muscles, and a full heart. In the chaos of building a business and raising a family, doing something just for me has been such a gift. It reminds me that joy doesn’t have to be productive — it just has to be yours.<br />

<h3>4. EQuatorial Pan Asian Restaurant: Bakery by day, Singaporean-style Izakaya by night (the perfect date spot!)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-223351" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Equatorial--900x643.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Equatorial--900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Equatorial--768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Equatorial-.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;This cosy Pan Asian Restaurant in Duxton Road vibes like a Singaporean-style Izakaya, complete with binchotan grilling, aged sashimi, and a beverage selection that pairs with just about anything on the menu. Chef Caleb brings a touch of nostalgia and refined traditions with dishes like the refreshing Seafood and Melon Salad ($17) – reminiscent of a classic Chinese wedding dinner dish, and a very unique Matcha Curry Grilled Masala Chicken ($24) – the flavours go surprisingly well together! The aged sea bream gently kissed by the Binchotan was a winner for its rich flavours and we loved the playful twist on Kaya Toast ($11) that even comes with an onsen egg!&#8221;<br />

<h3>5. Pixi Beauty: Andrina has found a quick and easy way for busy moms to look fresh</h3>
<figure id="attachment_223350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223350" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-223350 size-medium" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pixi-beauty-on-the-glow-base-900x643.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pixi-beauty-on-the-glow-base-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pixi-beauty-on-the-glow-base-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Pixi-beauty-on-the-glow-base.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-223350" class="wp-caption-text">Photos: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;They really mean it when they say they are &#8216;all about youth-enhancing multipurpose products.&#8217; I&#8217;m loving Pixi Beauty’s makeup range which helps us look fresh in a jiffy! Gently blur and even out skin tone with the On-the-Glow BASE (multi-use moisture stick), a buildable skin tint that’s infused with Ceramide NP, superfood berries, and fruit oils to give us glowing skin. One swipe is enough but you can load it up for more coverage. Now that it comes in 18 shades, it was super easy to find a match.&#8221;<br />

<h3>6. Esther has had her brows transformed with henna brows by La Vida!</h3>
<figure id="attachment_223930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223930" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-223930" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/la-vida-900x643.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/la-vida-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/la-vida-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/la-vida.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-223930" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Esther Chung</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;Ever since becoming a mum, my choices around beauty and wellness treatments have pivoted towards those that use natural ingredients. That’s why I jumped at the opportunity to try out <a href="https://www.lavida.com.sg/" rel="nofollow">La Vida</a>’s henna brow tinting, which uses natural henna dye to get the brow of my dreams (as you can see, my natural brows are barely visible). My therapist patiently walked me through the one-hour process and provided me with recommendations.</p>
<p>I opted for a more natural look with lighter tint, which she executed flawlessly. Though it looked more dramatic than I expected at first, my henna brows settled beautifully into that gorgeous “I woke up like this” look. I’d recommend it to my fellow mommas who are looking for brow shaping that’s non-invasive and natural. It’s also great for those with sparse brows like me. And what’s more – it’s halal-certified!&#8221; <em>&#8211; Esther</em></p>

<p>Back in the 2024 academic year, Stamford American fielded 90 representatives in the Inter-School Math Competition. Adding on to that, its Grade 11 participant, Brian beat over 300 participants from six international schools and won gold with his perfect 56/56 score.</p>
<p>Not long after that, the school made headlines at the 2024 American Mathematics Olympiad as well. Justin, a Stamford American Grade 5 student, secured first place not just at the school, national, and international levels. That’s a big win!</p>
<p>Most recently in February this year, Stamford American again made waves at the Inter-School Math Competition by winning overall first place, thanks to the efforts and hard work of its 62 talented student representatives. As a small token, the school awarded its students with 2,000 KrisFlyer miles each.</p>
<h3>What is Stamford American’s secret?</h3>

<p>Stamford American has always been known for its academic rigour, integrating the International Baccalaureate (IB) framework with American curriculum standards. Both the IB and the American curriculum are known for promoting critical thinking and problem solving skills among children, all of which are key traits needed to ace maths.</p>
<p>But that’s not all, the school’s student-centred approach enables it to nurture mathematical talent from a young age. Stamford American’s teachers provide personalised support to students who are strong in mathematics; and these students are provided with the suitable enrichment opportunities to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Stamford American allows its students to apply their classroom knowledge in competitive, real-world scenarios such as the inter-school and international competitions. Participating in competitions helps boost their confidence, and is an invaluable experience that will build their mathematical skills when they pursue advanced maths subjects in the IB or Advanced Placement programmes.</p>
<h3>Stamford American could unlock your kid’s potential</h3>

<p>We&#8217;re spoiled for choice with <a href="http://www.honeykidsasia.com/singapore/play/indoor-play-centres-in-singapore-the-best-adventure-playgrounds-for-babies-toddlers-and-kids/#qTIKJBSbtih2CWPi.97" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">indoor play centres in Singapore</a>, and one of the biggest ones on our kiddos must-visit lists is KidZania Singapore. We took along our eager junior reporters to see if KidZania lives up to the hype.</p>
<p>From the moment you spy the nose of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 737 poking out from the glass frontage, you know it’s going to be an impressive fit-out. But the question remains, is it worth your time and money?</p>
<p>The venue scores a resounding kids’ tick of approval (the smiles and pleads to go again are a good indication.) Ask the parents, however, and you get a slightly less excited response. In the interests of complete disclosure, we’ve drawn up a nifty list of pros and cons. Take a look at what we loved and what we didn’t about KidZania, and we’ll let you be the judge!</p>

<h3>Getting to KidZania Singapore</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212489" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212489" style="width: 1227px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-212489" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KidZania-Singapore-front.jpg" alt="KidZania Singapore" width="1227" height="781" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KidZania-Singapore-front.jpg 1227w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KidZania-Singapore-front-900x573.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KidZania-Singapore-front-768x489.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1227px) 100vw, 1227px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212489" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: KidZania Singapore</figcaption></figure>
<p>KidZania Singapore is located at 31 Beach View Road, #01-01/02 Sentosa Island, Singapore 098008. You can catch the Sentosa Express from Vivo City to Beach Station, or there is a car and taxi drop off point just out the front. There is also ample car parking at Beach Road Station Carpark.</p>

<h3>What is KidZania?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212505" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212505" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-212505" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KidZania-Singapore-Honeykids-Asia.png" alt="KidZania Singapore Honeykids Asia" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KidZania-Singapore-Honeykids-Asia.png 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KidZania-Singapore-Honeykids-Asia-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KidZania-Singapore-Honeykids-Asia-768x549.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212505" class="wp-caption-text">Photos: KidZania Singapore and Amanda Broad</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&#8217;s the low-down. Kids from age four to 14 years old can pick from over 80 role-playing scenarios within this educational facility. Have a chatty child who loves to talk? Head to the Kiss92 sound booth and let them try being a radio dj. Do they want to be a pilot? No kidding: there&#8217;s a life-sized 747 there for them to explore, complete with a flight simulator. Save the city as a firefighter or police officer, or be doctor, supermodel or sports star. Love bubble tea or salted egg snacks? Kids can try their hand at creating their own (and eat them afterwards!).</p>
<p><em>Pssst&#8230; Check out the <a href="https://www.kidzania.com.sg/activities" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list of activities</a> and check in with your little one on what they would most like to do &#8211; you can&#8217;t fit it all in one visit!</em></p>
<h3>KidZania Singapore admission prices and opening times</h3>
<p>The pricing system has been updated to be dynamic, and varies according to age group. Babies under one year old enter for free, and <strong>prices start at $41</strong>. Adults also need to pay for entry, as there is no included adult with a child price. <a href="https://kidzania-sg.thecoolmelon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Book online</a> to check the pricing for the day of your visit.</p>
<p>Doors open at 10am and closing time is 6pm daily. KidZania Singapore is closed on Wednesdays. <em>Pssst&#8230; for the best prices, book up to two months in advance to avoid spikes in pricing, and look out for <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-family-deals-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promo codes</a>!</em></p>
<h3>Saving and spending Kidzos</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212488" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212488" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-212488" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jac-and-Ivy-Kidzania-Kids-spa-Singapore.png" alt="Jac and Ivy Kidzania Kids spa Singapore" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jac-and-Ivy-Kidzania-Kids-spa-Singapore.png 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jac-and-Ivy-Kidzania-Kids-spa-Singapore-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jac-and-Ivy-Kidzania-Kids-spa-Singapore-768x549.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212488" class="wp-caption-text">A pampering spa session costs real money! Photo: Amanda Broad</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like in the real world, children will receive a wage whenever they knock off from work. Coming in the form of KidZos – the official currency of KidZania – kids get to manage their expenses and earnings just like Mum and Dad. Every child receives 50 KidZos on arrival, and the cheapest item you can purchase from the &#8216;department store&#8217; costs 60 Kidzos (a branded pencil), so the kids need to work hard to save up their KidZos if they want to be rewarded for their efforts!</p>
<p>The most expensive items we found cost 2,500 KidZos, which was a chef toy box and a fashion set. The kids will need multiple visits and a lot of time role playing to save up for this, with most activities only paying around 6 Kidzos.</p>
<p>Keep in mind some of the experiences that cost KidZos, so the kids can decide if they want to save or spend their wages. Here are some of the activities that charge a KidZo fee to join:</p>
<ul>
<li>Career discovery centre</li>
<li>Pilot academy</li>
<li>Model trainee</li>
<li>Photography student</li>
<li>University</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship camp</li>
</ul>
<p>A visit to the on-site Kith cafe will cost real money, as will a visit to Jac and Ivy&#8217;s Kidz Spa – nail painting costs $15, hair braids are $10. Check the price list on the door for the latest treatments available.</p>
<h3>KidZania PaZZports and the B. KidZanian programme</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212506" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212506" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-212506" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/A-peek-inside-KidZania-Singapore.png" alt="A peek inside KidZania Singapore" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/A-peek-inside-KidZania-Singapore.png 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/A-peek-inside-KidZania-Singapore-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/A-peek-inside-KidZania-Singapore-768x549.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212506" class="wp-caption-text">A peek inside KidZania Singapore! Photo: Amanda Broad</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kidzania.com.sg/bkidzanian" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">B-KiZanian CitiZenship Programme</a> is designed to encourage repeat visits and recognises your child&#8217;s learning and progress as they experience all of the different activities. To join, you need to purchase your child a &#8216;PaZZport&#8217; at a real-money cost of $38. By earning unique stamps in their &#8216;PaZZport&#8217; at each activity they complete, kids can climb the ranks of the programme. The more stamps they have, the more benefits (and discounts) you&#8217;ll receive!<br />
&#x200d;<br />
There are three levels of the B. KidZanian programme. These are &#8216;Naturalized CitiZen&#8217;, &#8216;Distinguished CitiZen&#8217; and &#8216;Honorable CitiZen&#8217;. At each level, your child can earn more KidZos per activity (this means less time working to earn enough to spend at the shop!). There are also progressive discounts at the KidZania Shop and Department Store.</p>
<p><strong>Is it worth it?</strong> Yes, if you are planning to visit multiple times. The PaZZport is also valid at other KidZania outlets, such as Kuala Lumpur, which is great to keep in mind if you are planning to travel to other KidZanias!</p>
<h2>KidZania Singapore: Pros &amp; cons</h2>
<h3>What we loved about KidZania</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212501" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212501" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-212501" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kidzania-Singapore-promo-code-discounts.png" alt="Kidzania Singapore promo code discounts" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kidzania-Singapore-promo-code-discounts.png 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kidzania-Singapore-promo-code-discounts-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kidzania-Singapore-promo-code-discounts-768x549.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212501" class="wp-caption-text">Photos: KidZania Singapore</figcaption></figure>
<h4>1. Role playing and life lessons</h4>
<p>The whole concept of kids role-playing in jobs of their dreams in a purpose built mini-city is edutainment at its best. Little ones learn not only great life-skills, but also realise that money doesn’t grow on trees, AND that you have to budget to buy what you want.</p>
<h4>2. Unique, fun experiences</h4>
<p>There are some awesome jobs on offer – like professional soccer player, photo journalist, fire-fighter, pilot and surgeon. Cuteness is a kid in a white lab coat or firefighter hat.</p>
<h4>3. Fostering independence and confidence</h4>
<p>Strictly no adults are allowed inside each activity. This was both good and problematic at times (see below). We got a real kick out of watching our kids asserting independence and gaining confidence. The activities are engaging and kept most of the kids entertained for the duration!</p>
<h4>4. Comfort built for families</h4>
<p>As an indoor theme park, KidZania has air-conditioning. Thumbs up! There is a baby care room with changing tables, a sink and a couch for feeding.</p>
<h3>What we<em> didn’t</em> love about KidZania</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212491" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212491" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-212491" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kidzania-Singapore-firefighting.png" alt="Kidzania Singapore firefighting" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kidzania-Singapore-firefighting.png 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kidzania-Singapore-firefighting-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kidzania-Singapore-firefighting-768x549.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212491" class="wp-caption-text">Make sure you queue up early for firefighting! Photos: KidZania Singapore and Amanda Broad</figcaption></figure>
<h4>1. The high costs</h4>
<p>It’s expensive for a family, with tickets starting from $41 (babies under one year old are free). Passports cost $38, however you do get rolling discounts and additional KidZo earning capacity when you have this. Still, this is not exactly a weekly drop-in play place. There’s a makeover salon that costs real money, with prices starting from $5 (this is on top of the admission fees, and KidZos are not accepted).</p>
<h4>2. Consumerism for kids, and the number of KidZos needed to redeem prizes</h4>
<p>With corporate sponsorship as far as the eye can see (CIMB, Shoppee, H&amp;M and Irvins, to name a few), it feels a bit like a branding exercise and like it&#8217;s encouraging consumerism (ick!). The experience culminates in the kids spending their hard earned KidZos at the retail shop. Unfortunately, the minimum spend is 60 KidZos, so our little worker went home empty-handed as they had spent their KidZos on the fun activities. We witnessed one nice mum giving away their unused currency to another family so they could afford a little piece of KidZania merchandise.</p>
<h4>3. Long queue times</h4>
<p>With a capacity of 1,500 the queues can be long (with waiting times sometimes being more 30 minutes). The bank had an almost constant line waiting to change KidZos for a debit card. We couldn’t get near some of the popular activities (no firefighting for us!).</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You must visit each activity when you arrive at KidZania to collect a time slot card, and be back at the activity 10 minutes before your slot for the following activities:</p>
<p>Pilot academy<br />
Fire station<br />
Police station<br />
Snacks factory<br />
Courier packing and delivery<br />
Paramedics<br />
Cookie making<br />
Pizza making<br />
Bubble tea making</p>
<p>To do the venue justice, you&#8217;ll need to spend a whole day at KidZania. Three hours only saw our kiddo role-play three activities!</p>
<h4>4. The parent-free concept</h4>
<p>The ‘parent-free’ concept is problematic for activities without viewing windows (like the aeroplane pilot simulation) as you have to stand outside and wait in case of an early finish (we saw one crying child with no mum in sight). Even when you <em>can</em> see your youngster, you can’t hear what they are being lectured on. Hmmm&#8230;</p>
<h3>The verdict: Is KidZania worth the hype?</h3>
<p>For us, yes! While it is expensive, the kids absolutely loved it and want to go back asap. There is something for all personality types &#8211; whether you have a kiddo who is curious and patient, sporty or loud, a wannabe popstar or pilot, a keen radio announcer, a fire or police officer, or even a sporting superstar, the kids loved it all. So we&#8217;ll be keeping an eye out for promo codes and booking our slots up to two months in advance!</p>
<p><strong>The kids were smiles all ‘round as we headed out the door! Let us know what you think of KidZania Singapore with a DM on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6-rxdfL_hO/?locale=zh-hans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>. </strong></p>

<h3>Before you go:</h3>
<ul>
<li>SuperPark is a cashless indoor playground, make sure to book your tickets online and fill out the <a href="https://waiver.roller.app/superparksingapore/?_gl=1*1qxtilk*_gcl_au*OTYzNDE4MzkuMTc0NzEwNjY2OQ..*_ga*NDQxMjM4OTcuMTc0NzEwNjY2OQ..*_ga_5BQYZ4PZVN*czE3NDg0MDYyNjEkbzMkZzEkdDE3NDg0MDYyNjYkajU1JGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> waiver form. </a>That&#8217;ll save you some time at the entrance.</li>
<li>Full grip socks are still required for safety purposes, add them for $3.50 when you purchase your tickets or trade-in your old socks for new ones at $2.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no age restrictions to enter but children below eight years old need to be accompanied by a trusted adult, and adult fee applies to the adult.</li>
<li>Dress light and appropriately for lots of movement. We did find athleisure leggings to be extremely useful for us adults when it came to sliding down the slides.</li>
<li>Make sure to arrive 10-15 minutes before your session, you don&#8217;t want to rush!</li>
<li>Each session is two hours but you can always purchase the Day Pass or memberships for longer play sessions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>At SuperPark Singapore:</h3>
<ul>
<li>NOTE: The entrance has relocated to the first floor (#01-488).</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a seating area to put on your grip socks and store your shoes.</li>
<li>Store your bags safely at the cashless lockers – $4 for two and half hours and $1 for every subsequent hour. Prepare a six- digit secret code.</li>
<li>There are height and weight restrictions at every station, please read them before use.</li>
<li>All games can be played with the grip socks except SuperClimb which requires covered shoes for safety purposes.</li>
<li>Before bouncing on the trampolines, make sure to empty your pockets, remove hair clips or any protruding hair pieces, or any other protruding items such as belts or studs on the clothes. Phones, cameras, and other handheld objects are not allowed on the mats as well.</li>
<li>Cool down with chilled, bottled water from the vending machine (cashless) at $2.50 per bottle.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exploring the play zones at SuperPark Singapore</h2>
<p>Spanning over 25,000 square feet, there&#8217;s something for everyone to play at SuperPark Singapore. Head straight to your favourite game zone or take your time and move around the park like we did. The new layout sees the indoor playground divided into three key zones – <em>Games Arena, Freestyle Hall, and Adventure Area</em>. Previous areas such as the skate park and the full ninja course have been replaced by exciting new games like Super Pixel (the floor is lava), new trampoline activities, and, of course, the Airbag Donut Slide, which we super love! And these are just part of the 13 new games which we will fill you in the details below.</p>
<h3>Games Arena</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225156" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225156" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-Games-arena-900x643.jpg" alt="Superpark Games arena" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-Games-arena-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-Games-arena-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-Games-arena.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225156" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are 18 interactive stations here where you can pit against your friends in easy games like Air Hockey or Super Archery. Or run your very own sports meet with shooting hoops, archery, and soccer, alongside new games like Super Boxer, Super Dash, and Super Run. We had a ball of a time at the Super Pinball, basically throwing or kicking balls to score points.  The little ones have their own Kids Olympics section but they will be happy to join you in a game of  SuperPixel (new), shouting &#8220;the floor is lava&#8221; at the top of their voices.</p>
<figure id="attachment_225159" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225159" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225159" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/games-arena-slide-900x643.jpg" alt="games arena slide" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/games-arena-slide-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/games-arena-slide-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/games-arena-slide.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225159" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Most of the games from the Games Arena can be found to the right of the entrance counter (behind the Super Recharge Cafe). For those that test your reflexes such as the Super Run, Super Boxer, I-Wall, and Hot Stepper, you&#8217;ll have to head to the second floor. It&#8217;s great fun coming down the windy twin slide, although we did get a little dizzy towards the end (the children were fully ok with it!). But it&#8217;s definitely easier and more fun than walking down the stairs!</p>
<h3>Freestyle Hall</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225157" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225157" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225157" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-freestyle-hall-900x643.jpg" alt="Superpark freestyle hall" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-freestyle-hall-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-freestyle-hall-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-freestyle-hall.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225157" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>For the bouncy, trampoline lovers, this is for you! The Freestyle Hall is home to trampolines, with new Basketball (bounce and shoot hoops) and Reaction Jumps (bounce and press buttons), alongside the Airbag and Valo Jump. Pro jumpers can have a go at the Runwall Jump, while the kiddos have their own space at the Kids Trampoline.</p>
<p>This is one area that the staff is very strict with height access, our not-so little ones had to to take their height against the wall ruler before they were allowed to enter. You can also scale up the Super Climb wall, but remember, you&#8217;ll need covered shoes for that. Unfortunately, this activity wasn&#8217;t ready during our preview. If the little ones are looking to move those hands and legs, there is a smaller Kids Climb, also new, you can look out for. Next to it is the new Kids Gym, complete with slide,  ball pit, and floating balls!</p>
<h3>Adventure Area</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225148" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225148" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225148" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-Airbag-Donut-Slide-900x643.jpg" alt="Superpark Airbag Donut Slide" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-Airbag-Donut-Slide-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-Airbag-Donut-Slide-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-Airbag-Donut-Slide.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225148" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>This might be our favourite zone because it has familiar stations like the Flying Fox and Pedal Car, and sports our favourite activity, the Airbag Donut Slide. Pick up a donut and pull it up the ramp – which has an improved grip than before, making it easier to go up. The distance up also feels a little shorter than before but the thrill&#8230; let&#8217;s just say, we couldn&#8217;t get enough of it! The slide starts pretty steep and sends us flying in the air before a soft landing on the airbag.</p>
<figure id="attachment_225149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225149" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225149" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-adventure-city-900x643.jpg" alt="Superpark adventure city" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-adventure-city-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-adventure-city-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Superpark-adventure-city.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225149" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our kids also loved the Adventure City, a tall-structure playground with a small ninja course, ball pit, and slides inside. There&#8217;s lots of climbing up and down, and the best part, adults can fit into most of the areas! So, if you&#8217;re that parent who wants to play with your kid, you can do so here. A new twirling Twin Slide Tower will send you down into a hidden nook – perfect to get away from the crowd a little. There&#8217;s a Sub Soccer (where you sit and play soccer under the table) and Ice Hockey table to while the time away. Get a picture or video here, when you slide down Adventure City, hand-in-hand with your kiddos. And if you are in a larger group, slide down all together for an epic video hook!</p>
<h2>Food, drinks, and birthday parties</h2>
<h3>Super Recharge Cafe</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225153" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225153" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Super-Recharge-cafe--900x643.jpg" alt="Super Recharge cafe" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Super-Recharge-cafe--900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Super-Recharge-cafe--768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Super-Recharge-cafe-.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225153" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo/ SuperPark</figcaption></figure>
<p>In between all the bouncing, climbing, and running around, hit the Super Recharge Café for a pit stop. They serve easy to eat food like hotdogs ($6.90), pizzas ($7.90), potato wedges (from $7.90), and chicken nuggets (from $7.90). But the thing our kids loved the most was the slushies ($4)! Four different fruit slushy flavours and you can mix and match them however you like. Of course, the kids ended up with galaxy-hued slushies; one even declared, &#8220;My slushy looks like unicorn poop!&#8221; There are no seats here, you&#8217;ll have to stand around the cocktail tables to fuel up.</p>
<h3>Parties and private events</h3>
<p>Who wouldn&#8217;t love a <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/kids-party-entertainers-planners-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">birthday party</a> at SuperPark, spending the day playing with their friends? With eight convertible party rooms on site, you can take your parties or corporate team-building events to the next level. Check with the SuperPark team on costs and availability, as there are different <a href="https://www.superpark.com.sg/bdayparties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">party packages</a> available depending on the number of kids!</p>
<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>Our visit to SuperPark was definitely great fun. The only problem is, two hours wasn&#8217;t enough for us at the media preview. Perhaps an <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/annual-memberships-singapore-attractions/">annual membership</a> with infinite play might make sense! We were thrilled to discover there are three membership types for SuperPark. The first is Super Lite, which is only $19.90 for 12 months, and gives you 20% off subsequent visits, along with some other benefits like a one-off $5 cafe voucher.</p>
<p>The other <a href="https://www.superpark.com.sg/memberships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuperPark membership</a> types are Super Gold and Super Family. Super Gold is for one person only (non transferable between kids, we checked). It offers unlimited entry to SuperPark for a whole year for $365, along with other benefits like birthday party discounts. Super Family covers 4 people for 12 months of unlimited entry at $1380, so it&#8217;s perfect if you want to take the whole fam regularly!</p>
<h3>Last thoughts&#8230;</h3>
<p>We are glad that SuperPark is back with new things to do because it&#8217;s one of our favourite indoor playgrounds where we can let loose and join our kids in play. Plus, it&#8217;s air-conditioned and has seats (almost) everywhere, it makes for a fun day out with the family.</p>

<h3>1. HAHA Chinese</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224624" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224624" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224624" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/haha-900x643.jpg" alt="summer camps haha chinese" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/haha-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/haha-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/haha.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224624" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: HAHA Chinese</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://form.jotform.com/251043536227451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HAHA Chinese</a> is running 17 summer camps this school holiday, including three new ones that are aligned with the Singapore Ministry of Education syllabus. Kids attending local schools can hop aboard the Mandarin Express to learn key Chinese vocabulary and concepts the fun way, which includes a half-day trip to the zoo and neighbourhood stores. For more adventure, HAHA Chinese has got your little explorers covered with over 10 activity camps, all based on exciting themes, folktales, and history – including one about Singapore in conjunction with National Day! Another cool thing about HAHA Chinese’s summer camps is that it’s never just about mastering Chinese; these camps teach your kids science, history, and various life skills as well. Plus, kids of all proficiency levels (yes, even if your kid is new to Chinese) are welcome to join the camps.</p>

Aptly named Newtonshow Junior, this new camp is designed for little campers to learn science, art, and cooking through age-appropriate activities. As for its signature science camps, expect all-time favourites like Harry Potter wizarding camp and superhero science camp to make a return; along with a new one that’s based on Sanrio’s characters: Hello Kitty, Kuromi, My Melody, and more. Lab camps, specially created for little scientists aged six to 12, are back by popular demand as well with advanced scientific camp activities like chromatography, medical case studies, and even a DIY biofuel experiment. Last but not least, Newtonshow Adventure camps are back in full swing too, with trips to Sentosa, River Wonders, the Southern Ridges, and even a goat farm; plus a new outdoor camp that’s based on Greek, Norse, and Egyptian mythologies. Interested in cooking and tinkering? Newtonshow runs these camps under Maker and Tomato Cooking School too (scroll down for more info).</p>

<p>From The Gruffalo-themed camps to learning cryptology as secret agents, <a href="https://online.cis.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CIS Holiday Camps</a> are truly where summer memories are made. With 90 cool camps spread across five categories to choose from, there’s something for every camper, no matter their interest and age (the camps cater to kids aged four to 14 years old). One thing that stands out for us is CIS Holiday Camps’ extensive offerings under the STEAM category, which include everything from foundational scientific experiments to physics and engineering, zoology, robotics, DNA extraction, and even esports. There’s also a scuba diving camp that serves as an introduction to PADI courses, as well as performing arts camps that end with little campers putting on full-scale musicals like Aladdin and Joseph. Want a camp that gives your kids a bit of everything? CIS Holiday Camps got you covered too, with camps like Fun Fanatics, Eco Explorers, Eric Carle’s Wonderland, and more.</p>

<p>On top of offering comprehensive fine arts-based classes, <a href="https://www.arthaus.com.sg/product/holiday-programs-for-kids-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARThausSG</a> has loads of holiday programmes for the kiddos as well. Designed for children aged five to 16, they can take their pick from acrylic painting, oil painting, watercolour, and more. You also have the option of signing the kids up for either a three or five-day camp. Children are taught according to their level, ability, and programme in a group setting. What we also love about ARThausSG’s holiday programmes is its low student-to-artist ratio, where there’s at least one artist guiding and overseeing a group of six students. This allows the workshops to be customised according to each child’s ability and experience levels.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s one thing certain about our rapidly changing world, it&#8217;s how fast technology is advancing, and consequently, how important tech skills are these days.

<p>Although Singapore may feel all skyscrapers and concrete at times – especially when the kids are demanding you <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/farm-visits-in-singapore-with-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring them to a farm</a> ‘right now’ – we still have plenty of <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-parks-for-kids-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty parks</a> and green patches alongside our urban jungle. And with that glorious green comes glorious wildlife! We’re not talking run-of-the-mill shrews and squirrels here: pangolins, otters and crocs; we’re looking at you! We’ve been donning our <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/rainy-weather-clothes-singapore-shoes-raincoats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wellies</a> and <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/hiking-in-singapore-with-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taking a hike around Singapore</a> to find the spots around the island where you may just find our weird and wonderful wildlife neighbours, with not a ticket queue or gift shop in sight.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve listed out some of the wildlife you can spot in Singapore, popular locations, and take note of their mating seasons to know when they might be most visible (but also most aggressive &#8211; always keep a wide berth!)</p>
<h2>What to do if you encounter wildlife in Singapore</h2>
<p>Wondering what to do if you come across any of these animals? We found <a href="https://www.ourwildneighbours.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Our Wild Neighbours</a> very helpful – it&#8217;s an initiative by the Urban Wildlife Working Group (UWG) that lists out tips and resources on how to coexist with native wildlife. We did some research and found this really <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/visit/when-visiting-parks/when-encountering-animals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helpful guide to wildlife encounters</a> from NParks. If you need urgent help on injured wildlife or have a case of wildlife in your home, call NParks’ 24-hour Animal Response Centre at 1800-476-1600 or ACRES at 9783 7782.</p>
<h2>The best of Singapore&#8217;s wild neighbours: Where and when you can spot wildlife in Singapore</h2>
<h3>1. Birds of Singapore: Oriental Pied Hornbills, Eurasian Golden Orioles and more</h3>
<p>Love bird watching? Get those wellies on, have your binoculars at the ready and brace yourselves for a good spot of our feathery friends! The good news is there is no shortage of birds across our island. Think birds like Oriental pied hornbills, Eurasian golden orioles, owls, parrots and many more. Looking to cheat-meet a wider range of winged buddies without having to survey the lands far and wide? Hot wing it with the fledglings to ‘<a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/bird-paradise-singapore-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bird Paradise</a>’ to check out the stunning residents in one spot. Psst… Our feathery friends sometimes visit urban areas too to find and feed on fruit. <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/visit/activities/birdwatching" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NParks</a> also has some tips and explains birdwatching etiquette – learn from the experts!</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Parks, forested areas, Bird Paradise</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>C</em><em>ommonly March to June for most species</em></p>
<h3>2. Chickens</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225125" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/chickens.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225125" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/chickens-900x643.png" alt="chickens" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/chickens-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/chickens-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/chickens.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225125" class="wp-caption-text">Spotted these two near our new office! Image: Raiz Redwan</figcaption></figure>
<p>Chickens aren&#8217;t really the first thing that comes to mind when you think of &#8216;wildlife in Singapore&#8217;, but they&#8217;re definitely not something you spot often during your day-to-day. Spotting them at residential areas or even in the city feels like seeing a rainbow – that might just be me though since they&#8217;re not common in my neighbourhood.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Several residential areas like Pasir Ris, Tampines, Ang Mo Kio, Pulau Ubin, parks, and nature reserves</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>Generally from February to June</em></p>
<h3>3. Peacocks and peahens</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225126" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225126" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/peacocks-and-peahens-wildlife-in-singapore.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225126" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/peacocks-and-peahens-wildlife-in-singapore-900x643.png" alt="peacocks and peahens wildlife in singapore" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/peacocks-and-peahens-wildlife-in-singapore-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/peacocks-and-peahens-wildlife-in-singapore-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/peacocks-and-peahens-wildlife-in-singapore.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225126" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Sentosa</figcaption></figure>
<p>These beautiful birds seem like they&#8217;re too beautiful to just be spotted in the wild, but you&#8217;d be surprised! <a href="https://www.sentosa.com.sg/en/get-inspired/sentosa-guides/sentosa-perfect-peafowls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sentosa</a> is home to the largest population of these beautiful birds, estimated to be over 60 peafowls. There&#8217;s even a rare white peafowl – they are born with a condition known as leucism that reduces pigmentation in their body.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Sentosa</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>February to August</em></p>
<h3>4. Swans</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225127" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225127" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/swans-wildlife-in-singapore.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225127" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/swans-wildlife-in-singapore-900x643.png" alt="swans wildlife in singapore" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/swans-wildlife-in-singapore-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/swans-wildlife-in-singapore-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/swans-wildlife-in-singapore.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225127" class="wp-caption-text">Image: NParks via Facebook</figcaption></figure>
<p>The best place to spot the graceful swans has to be <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/our-gardens/tanglin-entrance/swan-lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swan Lake</a> in the Singapore Botanical Gardens. They&#8217;re home to some black and white swans, although there aren&#8217;t that many so they could be hard to spot.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Swan Lake. Singapore Botanical Gardens</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>March to May</em></p>
<h3>5. Tortoise and turtle</h3>
<p>These delightful little shelled creatures are a common sighting across the island, and the good news is you won’t have to venture very far either. If you haven&#8217;t spotted one yet, chances are you will get a glimpse of them swimming alongside Koi fish at ponds and lakes. If exploring the wild side of things floats your boat, endangered sea turtles like the green turtle and hawksbill turtle have been spotted around the Southern <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-beaches-in-singapore-for-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">islands of Singapore</a>. Did we mention there are even turtle nests and hatching sites at the Marine Park, Small Sister&#8217;s Islands?</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Ponds, lakes, Southern Islands</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>May to October</em></p>
<h3>6. Malayan Colugo</h3>
<p>Commonly known as the Flying Lemur, the Malayan Colugo is a nocturnal animal that feeds on leaves, leaf shoots, and flower buds. If you spot a shy and long animal with slender limbs gliding between trees, chances are you&#8217;ve made your first Malayan Colugo sighting!</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Central Catchment <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/nature-reserves-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature Reserve</a>, Bukit Batok Nature Park</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>Throughout the year</em></p>
<h3>7. Dugong</h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-184235 aligncenter" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-spot-wildlife-in-singapore-dugong-sea-cow-hero-900x643.jpg" alt="Dugongs | Singapore's wildlife" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-spot-wildlife-in-singapore-dugong-sea-cow-hero-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-spot-wildlife-in-singapore-dugong-sea-cow-hero-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-spot-wildlife-in-singapore-dugong-sea-cow-hero.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Known as sea cows – but ironically more likely to be found in Singapore than actual cows – dugongs (pictured above) are the gentle giants of the ocean. Unfortunately, they&#8217;re classified as critically endangered and  face threats from human activities like hunting, bycatch in fishing nets, and the loss of seagrass habitats.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Waters around the Northeast of Singapore, Changi, Pulau Ubin, and Pulau Tekong</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>Throughout the year</em></p>
<h3>8. Otters</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225145" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/otters.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225145" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/otters-900x643.png" alt="otters" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/otters-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/otters-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/otters.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225145" class="wp-caption-text">Our wonderful writer spotted these cute critters! Image: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Otters are undeniably cute. A sighting of these adorable creatures is sure to make anyone&#8217;s day. These guys are getting easier and easier to sight (we&#8217;ve even had them make an appearance near our home!). They have even made way into people&#8217;s homes – you might remember a man <a href="https://mothership.sg/2021/09/otters-koi-pond-yio-chu-kang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing his prized Koi fish</a> after otters ate them! The kids will want to get close and hug them… but don&#8217;t. It’s easy to be fooled by their cute appearance. <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/animals/wildlife-in-singapore/otters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NParks</a> advises not to feed them, talk loudly near them, or chase them!</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Marina Bay, Robertson Quay, Sungei Buloh Nature Reserve, Pulau Ubin, Serangoon, Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, and Punggol</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>Throughout the year</em></p>
<h3>9. Wild boars</h3>
<figure id="attachment_211336" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-211336" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-211336" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wild-boars-singapore-nparks-max-khoo-900x643.jpg" alt="wild boars singapore nparks max khoo" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wild-boars-singapore-nparks-max-khoo-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wild-boars-singapore-nparks-max-khoo-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wild-boars-singapore-nparks-max-khoo.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-211336" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Max Khoo via NParks</figcaption></figure>
<p>Wild boars are native to Singapore and can grow up to a whopping 100kg – so don’t get in their way! While they generally shy away from humans,  mothers tend to get aggressive, especially when protecting their kids. Also, do note that it is <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/publications-resources/articles/when-not-feeding-is-caring#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20anyone,wildlife%20that%20human%20commonly%20feed.&amp;text=Hence%20there%20is%20no%20need%20for%20us%20to%20feed%20them." target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal to feed them</a> – offenders could face a maximum fine of up to $10,000! That&#8217;s one expensive feeding experience.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Pulau Ubin, Pulau Tekong, and the Western Catchment Area</em><br />

<p>These crafty fellas have totally got the measure of us human folk and have sussed out that when there are people about, there is often food, too. Unfortunately, this means they can spot a carrier bag from the top of the highest tree! You’ll find them in all the forested areas around Singapore, and they can often be seen in residential areas these days too.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Central Catchment Nature Reserve, and other areas within the Western Catchment Area, Bukit Batok Nature Park, and Sentosa</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>Throughout the year</em></p>
<h3>11. Porcupine</h3>
<p>Not a cuddly kind of creature, although certainly an adorable one. Porcupines were once feared to be extinct in Singapore but have been spotted alive and well over at Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong. They&#8217;re way more prickly than even the grumpiest of kids: stand back if you find one!</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>September to December</em></p>
<h3>12. Civet cat</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225123" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225123" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Civet-cat.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225123" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Civet-cat-900x643.png" alt="Civet cat" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Civet-cat-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Civet-cat-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Civet-cat.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225123" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Our Wild Neighbours</figcaption></figure>
<p>The word &#8216;cat&#8217; is a bit misleading – these furry cuties are actually closely related to mongooses (or is it mongeese?). The common palm civet is the most likely kind of civet you’ll spot around Singapore. Look for them in forests, parks, mangroves and even your back garden. Psst: they&#8217;re not averse to a nighttime rummage around urban areas! You&#8217;ll find them all over Singapore. Just don&#8217;t forget to look up: they love to lurk in the trees.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>F</em><em>orests, parks, mangroves, and the roof spaces of buildings in urban areas</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>September to December</em></p>
<h3>13. Pangolin</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225124" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225124" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pangolin-wildlife-in-singapore.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225124" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pangolin-wildlife-in-singapore-900x643.png" alt="pangolin wildlife in singapore" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pangolin-wildlife-in-singapore-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pangolin-wildlife-in-singapore-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pangolin-wildlife-in-singapore.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225124" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Mandai Nature</figcaption></figure>
<p>You may think you&#8217;ve stumbled across proof of alien life, but the truly odd-looking pangolin is really a shy, nocturnal mammal. It&#8217;s covered in entirely earthly scales… made of compressed hair! Occasionally, they wander into residential areas, but mostly you can spot them around the forested areas. Just make sure to be careful when driving near their habitat – there have been <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/the-fight-to-stop-pangolin-extinction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports in recent years</a> of these cute creatures becoming roadkill.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Central Catchment Nature Reserve, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Bukit Batok, Pulau Ubin,  and Pulau Tekong</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>Between July and October</em></p>
<h3>14. Dolphins</h3>
<p>Are you as surprised as we are? Yup, wild dolphins live off the shores of Singapore. In particular, Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins and Indo-Pacific bottle dolphins are often spotted wild and happy in the Straits of Singapore, usually between here and Batam.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Waters between St. John&#8217;s and Lazarus Islands</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>Most active in the spring and summer months</em></p>
<h3>15. Estuarine Crocodile</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225122" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225122" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Estuarine-Crocodile-wildlife-in-singapore.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225122" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Estuarine-Crocodile-wildlife-in-singapore-900x643.png" alt="Estuarine Crocodile wildlife in singapore" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Estuarine-Crocodile-wildlife-in-singapore-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Estuarine-Crocodile-wildlife-in-singapore-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Estuarine-Crocodile-wildlife-in-singapore.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225122" class="wp-caption-text">Image: David Tan via Facebook</figcaption></figure>
<p>Crocs in Singapore, you say? (No, we&#8217;re not talking about the rubber <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/where-to-buy-shoes-babies-toddlers-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sandals that kids love to wear</a>.) Yes, estuarine crocodiles, also called saltwater crocodiles or &#8216;salties&#8217; are native to Singapore! But there&#8217;s no need to run for the hills just yet – just stay away from suspicious moving logs in the water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Sungei Buloh, Kranji Reservoir and West Coast, and Pasir Ris Park</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>November to May</em></p>
<h3>16. Mousedeer</h3>
<p>Is it a mouse, or is it a deer? They&#8217;re probably closer to deer but smaller – kinda like a teacup poodle. They used to be hunted for their meat, which was said to be more tender than venison. But thankfully, these adorable creatures have been under the Wild Animals and Birds Protection Order since 1947 and are no longer being hunted.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to spot: </em></strong><em>Pulau Ubin, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, MacRitchie Reservoir, and Central Catchment Nature Reserve</em><br />
<strong><em>Mating season: </em></strong><em>Typically between March and May</em></p>
<p><strong>Now go spot something cool, and don&#8217;t forget to <a href="hello@honeykidsasia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">send us your photos!</a></strong></p>

<h2>SG60 benefits</h2>
<h3>11. SG60 vouchers</h3>
<p>We Singaporeans live for vouchers, especially with the GST going up yet again. Much like CDC vouchers, these <a href="https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/schemes/BX7Se4Pg/sg60-vouchers" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SG60 vouchers</a> can be used at all businesses that accept CDC vouchers, like heartland merchants’ stores, hawkers’ stalls, supermarkets, and more! Those aged 21 to 29 will receive $600, and those aged 60 and above will receive $800. They&#8217;ll be distributed across July 2025 and expire only in 31 December 2026 so make them last!</p>
<h3>12. Support local with SG Culture Pass</h3>
<p>If you frequent local <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/kids-theatre-shows-and-musicals-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">theatre shows</a>, performances, exhibitions, and experiences, you&#8217;ll love the<a href="https://www.sg60.gov.sg/budget-initiatives/sg-culture-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> SG Culture Pass</a>. If you&#8217;re 18 and above, you&#8217;ll receive $100 worth of credits to offset the cost of tickets – hopefully, this will encourage you to go out to more local shows! But you&#8217;ll have to hold on a little longer – you&#8217;ll only receive the credits on 1 September 2025. These credits will last you till 31 December 2028, so you can use them for something you really want to attend!</p>

<p>The SG60 <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/singapore-souvenirs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">souvenirs</a> from Singapore Mint are beautiful and incredibly detailed! They draw inspiration mainly from Singapore’s heritage districts, the Merlion, and the kebaya, which you can see in the magnets, bookmarks, and medallions. These pieces are a great gift for collectors of anything Singapore so make sure to pre-order them before they&#8217;re gone!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://honeykidsasia.com/once-upon-a-tide/">FIRST LOOK: We checked out the new Once Upon a Tide exhibition at the National Museum of Singapore</a></p>
<p>As Singapore enters its <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/sg60-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweet sixties</a>, we should take the time to appreciate the tremendous growth it achieved, even way before gaining independence. It felt extremely surreal travelling through 700 years of Singapore&#8217;s history at <a href="https://www.nhb.gov.sg/nationalmuseum/whats-on/exhibition/once-upon-a-tide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Once Upon a Tide</a>, the number of well-preserved relics on display blew me away. While it might sound pretty dry, there were actually lots of activities for the little ones, from interactive exhibits to play areas. Plus, it&#8217;s free for all Singaporeans and PRs! If you&#8217;re not convinced yet, read on as I go more in-depth on my experience at Once Upon a Tide and the <a href="https://www.nhb.gov.sg/nationalmuseum/whats-on/programme/childrens-season-2025/events#section_Building-Our-Singapore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get Curious! Building Our Singapore</a> interactive installation that complements it.</p>
<h2>Five sections to explore</h2>
<h3>Cool artefacts</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225070" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Section-One-Always-on-the-Map.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225070" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Section-One-Always-on-the-Map-900x643.png" alt="Section One Always on the Map" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Section-One-Always-on-the-Map-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Section-One-Always-on-the-Map-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Section-One-Always-on-the-Map.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225070" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Raiz Redwan</figcaption></figure>
<p>Each section of Once Upon a Tide takes you through Singapore&#8217;s historic journey, with a total of 350 artefacts from the National Collection.  Maps that date all the way back to the 1800s, audio testimonials from people who built the country, a letter from Sir Stamford Raffles to the town planning committee – there are so many well-preserved pieces of history for you to check out! I learnt so much about Singapore&#8217;s journey, and it makes me proud seeing how far we&#8217;ve come and the global impact we have today.</p>
<h3>Interactive elements</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225071" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225071" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Section-Two_-The-River-Road-Sampan-Challenge.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225071" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Section-Two_-The-River-Road-Sampan-Challenge-900x643.png" alt="Section Two_ The River Road - Sampan Challenge" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Section-Two_-The-River-Road-Sampan-Challenge-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Section-Two_-The-River-Road-Sampan-Challenge-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Section-Two_-The-River-Road-Sampan-Challenge.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225071" class="wp-caption-text">Image: National Museum of Singapore</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before you even walk into the exhibit, you&#8217;ll be given an RFID tag that you can use throughout the exhibit to collect your responses to questions about Singapore&#8217;s history. At the end of the exhibit, you&#8217;ll be assigned one of four virtual avatars based on your responses and will add to a larger cityscape visual that represents the collective vision of Singapore’s tomorrow, made up by all those who visited.</p>
<p>Each section also has its own interactive elements – one of my personal favourites was the Sampan Challenge in Section Two: The River Road! Pick up the oars and “row across” the Singapore River in this interactive video game where you ferry passengers to their destination.</p>
<h3>Beautiful art and displays</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225065" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225065" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Once-Upon-a-Tide-art.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225065" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Once-Upon-a-Tide-art-900x643.png" alt="Once Upon a Tide art" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Once-Upon-a-Tide-art-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Once-Upon-a-Tide-art-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Once-Upon-a-Tide-art.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225065" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Raiz Redwan</figcaption></figure>
<p>The amount of reading can be overwhelming when you go to exhibits like these, but don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s so much beautiful art to admire! Don&#8217;t get me wrong, learning about Singapore&#8217;s history is interesting but if you want to take a break and process what you&#8217;ve learnt, take some time to appreciate how visually stunning the exhibition is.</p>
<h2>Things for kids to do</h2>
<h3>11 colourful books in Once Upon a Tide</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225066" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225066" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Waves-of-Wonder-Once-Upon-a-Tide.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225066" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Waves-of-Wonder-Once-Upon-a-Tide-900x643.png" alt="Waves of Wonder Once Upon a Tide" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Waves-of-Wonder-Once-Upon-a-Tide-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Waves-of-Wonder-Once-Upon-a-Tide-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Waves-of-Wonder-Once-Upon-a-Tide.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225066" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Raiz Redwan</figcaption></figure>
<p>This one is for the kiddos! There are 11 colourful Waves of Wonder books throughout the exhibit that offer bite-sized summaries of the sections with cute graphics. Plus, they&#8217;re placed closer to the floor – just at the right height for the little ones to read and enjoy! To encourage them to learn, these books also contain missions for them to complete with information they can gather in each section. Just make sure they don&#8217;t cheat and read the answers at the back like I did!</p>
<h3>Photo opps and play areas</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225068" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Once-Upon-a-Tide-and-Childrens-Seasons-play-areas.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225068" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Once-Upon-a-Tide-and-Childrens-Seasons-play-areas-900x643.png" alt="Once Upon a Tide and Childrens Seasons play areas" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Once-Upon-a-Tide-and-Childrens-Seasons-play-areas-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Once-Upon-a-Tide-and-Childrens-Seasons-play-areas-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Once-Upon-a-Tide-and-Childrens-Seasons-play-areas.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225068" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Raiz Redwan</figcaption></figure>
<p>To help the kiddos better engage with the exhibition, the National Museum has created a Programmes Cart filled with activities that pre-school and special needs schools can use during their self-guided visits. There are colouring activities, puzzles to solve, and fun books to flip through – and they&#8217;re all local-themed! In the Children&#8217;s Season Get Curious! Building Our Singapore installation, they also have several play areas. One of them has tables themed after the old void-deck tables and a selection of traditional games like Old Maid, spinning tops, pick up sticks, and more!</p>
<h2>Tips and things to note</h2>
<h3>How to get to the National Museum of Singapore</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t make the mistake I made when I went down to check it out and get off at Dhoby Ghaut – I had to take a 10-15 minute walk to the National Museum in the sweltering heat. If you want to take the MRT, stop at Bencoolen or Bras Basah station instead and you&#8217;ll have a shorter walk. For those taking the bus, alight at the YMCA bus stop for a two to five minute walk over! Those planning to drive over, be warned. Their car park is currently closed to facilitate upgrading works so you&#8217;ll have to park at nearby buildings like Singapore Management University, the Lazada One building, Fort Canning Park and YMCA.</p>
<h3>Accesibility</h3>
<p>In general, the National Museum is extremely accessible with complimentary manual wheelchairs, stroller parking outside galleries, and even sensory bags to help children on the autism spectrum calm down if they get overstimulated. As for the Once Upon a Tide exhibition specifically, they are also wheelchair and pram friendly too. But some sections do become a little narrow so it might be a bit challenging to navigate if there&#8217;s a crowd. As for the Get Curious! Building Our Singapore installation, there should be no issues navigating through it as it&#8217;s mostly open areas.</p>
<h3>Places to eat near the National Museum of Singapore</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s quite a few options if you&#8217;re looking to fuel up after a visit. While walking back, I noticed 90 Minutes &#8211; Korean Tteokbokki Hotpot Buffet and Buddy Hoagies Steak &amp; Grill Restaurant, which would make great places for the fam to check out. But since I was alone, I headed to Plaza Singapura which has so many options to choose from! They even had a Halal Korean cafe that served classics like jjapaghetti, tteokbokki, and bingsu that I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>As a parent, I&#8217;ve often wondered what the future holds for my child, sometimes I even worry! But after hearing from the artists and visiting <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.sg/sg/en/exhibitions/gallery-childrens-biennale.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallery Children&#8217;s Biennale </a>2025, I am reminded that the future isn&#8217;t just something that happen to us – it&#8217;s something we get to shape. Just like how this year&#8217;s experience was co-created with students from Qifa Primary School, who actively shared their feedback and joined the artists in the making of the artworks.</p>
<p>Returning for its fifth edition, Gallery Children&#8217;s Biennale 2025 encourages both young (and old) to explore the endless possibilities of the future through art and play. This year’s theme, <em>“Tomorrow, We’ll Be…”</em>, features eight talented Asian artists who bring their hopes and dreams to life through playful, imaginative artworks that spark big ideas around <em>Joy, Kindness, Dream, and Love</em>. As a champion for inclusivity, this year&#8217;s experience is made, for the first time, baby-friendly! Yes, <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-ergonomic-baby-carriers-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">babies</a> and toddlers will get to join in the fun, think baby-friendly experiences like downward-facing displays, padded areas, tactile and auditory stimulation in safe <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/shopping-malls-with-amazing-play-areas-for-kids-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play spaces</a>. Take a sneak peek into the play areas on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKAMmKgzSH9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>

<h2>Top tips to enjoying Gallery Children&#8217;s Biennale 2025</h2>
<figure id="attachment_225077" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225077" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225077" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-kv-900x643.jpg" alt="Childrens biennale kv" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-kv-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-kv-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-kv.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225077" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Children&#8217;s Biennale</figcaption></figure>
<h3>1. Allow at least three hours for slow, leisurely exploration</h3>
<p>Allocate time to explore the artworks without rushing. The artworks encourage free play and it’s through this freedom that children are able to observe, discover, and notice details within each piece. In our media preview, we, the adults, took two and half hours to explore and play at all eight artworks. We think the children might need more time!</p>
<h3>2. Look for the information boards at each artwork</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225079" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225079" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225079" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Info-boards-at-childrens-biennale-2025-900x643.jpg" alt="Info boards at childrens biennale 2025" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Info-boards-at-childrens-biennale-2025-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Info-boards-at-childrens-biennale-2025-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Info-boards-at-childrens-biennale-2025.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225079" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you move through the artworks, keep an eye out for information boards that share insights about the artist and their work. More importantly, they offer conversation starters so you can better engage with your child, alongside reflections from the children who helped in the creation of the artwork.</p>
<h3>3. Collect stamps to redeem a prize</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225085" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225085" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225085" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/my-biennale-buddy-2025-900x643.jpg" alt="my biennale buddy 2025" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/my-biennale-buddy-2025-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/my-biennale-buddy-2025-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/my-biennale-buddy-2025.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225085" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Make sure to pick up a copy of the My Biennale Buddy activity booklet onsite with a recommended donation of $2. Besides information about the artist and artworks, you&#8217;ll find a handy map that shows you how to get to the various artworks, and it even includes a stamping activity. Collect a stamp at each artwork you visit, complete all eight and redeem your gift at the Tours and Programmes Counter on level 1 (while stocks last).</p>
<h3>4. Bring home Art Packs for only $8</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225086" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225086" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225086" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/childrens-biennale-art-packs-2025-900x643.jpg" alt="children's biennale art packs 2025" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/childrens-biennale-art-packs-2025-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/childrens-biennale-art-packs-2025-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/childrens-biennale-art-packs-2025.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225086" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bring home a piece of the Gallery Children’s Biennale 2025 with Art Packs (from $8), available from four vending machines located of level 1 and B1. What&#8217;s cool is that the Art Packs are tailored for two age groups – one for children six years and below, and another for those seven and up.</p>
<h2>Must-see artworks at Gallery Children&#8217;s Biennale 2025</h2>
<p>Designed and built with creativity, curiosity, and for a whole lot of fun, here’s our rundown of the eight must-see, must-play artworks at National Gallery Singapore.</p>
<h3>1. Colourful Play</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225088" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225088" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225088" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/colourful-play-900x643.jpg" alt="colourful play" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/colourful-play-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/colourful-play-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/colourful-play.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225088" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>In a first-time collaboration with ART:DIS, Singaporean artist <strong>Fern Wong</strong> brings joy to life with vibrant papercuts using magnetic papercut shapes and designs in Colourful Play. As you arrive at the interactive wall, think about what brings you Joy. Look into the odd-shaped mirrors, then move the magnetic pieces to express your emotions, a chance for children to co-create the artwork. There are also tactile shapes and rattling spin boxes which are mounted low on the wall, inviting babies and toddlers to explore through touch, movement, and sound.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where:</strong> B1, City Hall Wing</em></p>
<h3>2. Lessons in Being Kind</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225078" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225078" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225078" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Colourful-Play-at-childrens-biennale-2025-900x643.jpg" alt="Lessons in being kind at childrens biennale 2025" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Colourful-Play-at-childrens-biennale-2025-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Colourful-Play-at-childrens-biennale-2025-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Colourful-Play-at-childrens-biennale-2025.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225078" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>This cute stop-motion film tells the story of a blob on a journey of self-discovery and shares Lessons in Being Kind, to others and to self. Laotian artist, <strong>Souliya Phoumivong</strong>, took inspiration from an egg to create this 11,000-frame animation. Some of the clay figures in the animation are made by students from Qifa Primary school. If this inspires your kiddos to create their own stop-motion videos, there&#8217;s a corner with clay blobs to try it out. Sit and watch the animation on the floor, climb the little mounts, or try the fun balancing chair that encourages teamwork.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where:</strong> B1, City Hall Wing</em></p>
<h3>3. Fantasy</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225084" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225084" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225084" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-2025-Fantasy-900x643.jpg" alt="Childrens biennale 2025 Fantasy" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-2025-Fantasy-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-2025-Fantasy-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-2025-Fantasy.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225084" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>What will you do with 130kg of children&#8217;s clothes? Malaysian-based art collective <strong>Co2_karbondioksida</strong> turned them into a dreamy playscape in Fantasy, along with 400 donated toys! Dreams take flight in the safety of comfort and care. And that is what the artists envisions for everyone, to feel safe and secure to dream up the infinite possibilities for the future. The soft space draws children to jump and play, but you can also lie down and look up, just don&#8217;t fall asleep! Great for both big and small kids.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where:</strong> B1, City Hall Wing</em></p>
<h3>4. Imaginary Peach Garden</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225082" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225082" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Imaginary-Peach-Garden-900x643.jpg" alt="Imaginary Peach Garden" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Imaginary-Peach-Garden-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Imaginary-Peach-Garden-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Imaginary-Peach-Garden.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225082" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is one of our favourite artworks for its interactivity and use of digital media in storytelling. South Korean artist YeSeung Lee invites children to dream up fantastical creatures which will be projected into the digital world. Younger children will delight making creatures out of modular foam puzzles, and you can add a touch of tech to their creations when you scan the QR codes on the table. The space also features large inflatable forms that breathe like living creatures—blurring the lines between reality and imagination. Scan the QR codes on the floor and see yourself in AR. Do note that this space is slightly dimmed due to digital projection.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where:</strong> B1, Supreme Court Wing</em></p>
<h3>5. I We Them</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225087" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225087" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225087" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/I-we-them-900x643.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/I-we-them-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/I-we-them-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/I-we-them.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225087" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sitting right across the Imaginary Peach Garden is the whimsical world of I We Them. Created by Singapore-based Spanish artist Vicente Delgado—aka Tito, find hand-drawn characters on inflatables, cushions, and everywhere. Parents will love this space as there are chairs – even a plush couch –all around. Don&#8217;t just sit there, make sure you look up and down for the secrets of these chairs. For the younger ones, there is a foamed flower bed for free play and tactile elements on the wall to spin and play. This is one place that celebrates love, togetherness, and connection. Another one of our favourites to hang out!</p>
<p><em><strong>Where</strong>: B1, Supreme Court Wing</em></p>
<h3>6. Home is Where the Heart is</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225081" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225081" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225081" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-2025-home-is-where-the-heart-is-900x643.jpg" alt="Childrens biennale 2025 home is where the heart is" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-2025-home-is-where-the-heart-is-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-2025-home-is-where-the-heart-is-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-2025-home-is-where-the-heart-is.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225081" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>A heartwarming tribute to community and belonging, Home Is Where The Heart Is, a charming installation by National Gallery Singapore for the Children’s Biennale 2025. Inspired by the late Mohamed Salehuddin’s nostalgic painting Malay House, Malacca, this interactive mural reimagines a vibrant kampung neighbourhood and HDB flats. Children can ring doorbells, peek into homes, and greet a friendly pushcart ice cream uncle, while parents and grandparents are invited to share stories of home.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where:</strong> L1, Supreme Court Wing</em></p>
<h3>7. Kindness Garden</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225080" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225080" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225080" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-kindness-garden-900x643.jpg" alt="Childrens biennale kindness garden" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-kindness-garden-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-kindness-garden-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Childrens-biennale-kindness-garden.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225080" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another of our favourite space is the Kindness Garden, Japanese-Australian artist Hiromi Tango. It&#8217;s a multi-sensorial artwork infused with thoughts of kindness. A mild lavender scent hits you once you enter the space and that comes from the Lavender dome – a calming nook to wind down in, before the kids takeover the play space. At the heart of the space is the sound flower, with petals that play a sound when you press down on them.  They are inscribed with words of kindness in braille and words, offering a glimpse into the experiences of the visually impaired. There are also braille alphabets inscribed on the pillars. This inclusive space encourages emotional connection, sensory exploration, and a deeper appreciation of the diverse communities around us.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where:</strong> L1, City Hall Wing</em></p>
<h3>8. Dance Dance Chromatics</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225089" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225089" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225089" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/colourful-play-1-900x643.jpg" alt="Dance dance chromatic" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/colourful-play-1-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/colourful-play-1-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/colourful-play-1.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225089" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Wyn-lyn Tan</figcaption></figure>
<p>Get ready to get moving at Dance Dance Chromatics, created by Singaporean artist, Wyn-lyn Tan. Originally trained in Chinese landscape painting, she loves experimenting with different elements, including copper and patina, in her art. For this particular piece, she takes a playful inspiration from the game, Dance Dance Revolution. As an avid closet dancer herself, she encourages the Joy of movement and free expression through this artwork. Step on the pads on the floor and watch the painting flow in an almost ethereal way, keep moving to unlock special effects. You&#8217;ll know you&#8217;re there when you see the swirls – we, adults couldn&#8217;t keep up with it enough to get the swirls out, so get your kiddos involved in this one! We&#8217;re sure they&#8217;d love to dance and move along with you.</p>

<p>When I became <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/10-perks-of-being-pregnant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pregnant</a> and stumbled upon hypnobirthing, I quickly dismissed it as another <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/weird-silly-pregnancy-superstitions-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pregnancy &#8216;fad&#8217;</a>. In my eyes, it was reserved for the yoga mums out there – not me. Little did I know, I&#8217;d soon eat my words and end up being an advocate for it. Before I share all the details on my own hypnobirthing journey (plus all the fab resources and classes if you do decide to explore hypnobirthing in Singapore), let&#8217;s start with a little more info about what hypnobirthing is all about&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">HYPNOBIRTHING IN SINGAPORE &#8211; ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW</h2>
<h3>What is hypnobirthing?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/giving-birth/pain-relief/hypnobirthing" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tommy&#8217;s Pregnancy Hub</a> describes hypnobirthing as &#8220;a method of pain management that can be used during labour and birth, involving a mixture of visualisation, relaxation and deep breathing techniques.&#8221; Basically, it uses hypnosis to take on labour pain, helping mums re-frame pain and to see childbirth as a positive process. The general idea is if you can reduce the fear factor that comes with birth, your body can relax and produce endorphins rather than the stress hormones that can cause your muscles to tense up, which should make birth a little bit easier.</p>
<h3>What are the benefits of hypnobirthing?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225044" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225044" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225044" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hypnobirthing-in-Singapore-Kate-Middleton-is-a-fan-900x643.png" alt="Hypnobirthing in Singapore Kate Middleton is a fan" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hypnobirthing-in-Singapore-Kate-Middleton-is-a-fan-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hypnobirthing-in-Singapore-Kate-Middleton-is-a-fan-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hypnobirthing-in-Singapore-Kate-Middleton-is-a-fan.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225044" class="wp-caption-text">Kate Middleton and Prince William with baby George. Even royalty are fans of hypnobirthing! Photo: People.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>The big question, of course, is, does hypnobirthing work? Well, there&#8217;s heaps of <a href="https://www.nct.org.uk/sites/default/files/related_documents/Research%20overview-%20Self%20hypnosis%20for%20labour%20and%20birth%20%282011%29_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">research</a> out there showing the merits of hypnobirthing, plus some pretty famous fans (Angelina Jolie and Megan Markle were both rumoured to use it!).</p>
<p>The benefits of hypnobirthing vary dramatically from mum to mum, but some possible pluses include:</p>
<p>1. The possibility of giving birth without the need for pain relief.<br />
2. Feeling more relaxed during labour and being more likely to enjoy the experience (apparently <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/lessons-ive-learnt-from-having-three-kids-advice-for-duchess-of-cambridge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kate Middleton</a>, who&#8217;s a fan, said she &#8220;really quite enjoyed it!&#8221;)<br />
3. Less chance of intervention such as assisted births and caesarean birth<br />
4. The feeling of control for mums<br />
5. Potential to shorten labour (specifically the first stages)</p>
<h2>My hypnobirthing experience&#8230;</h2>
<figure id="attachment_225045" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225045" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225045" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jonathan-Borba-pregnancy-photo-Singapore-900x643.png" alt="" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jonathan-Borba-pregnancy-photo-Singapore-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jonathan-Borba-pregnancy-photo-Singapore-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jonathan-Borba-pregnancy-photo-Singapore.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225045" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Jonathan Borba via Pexels</figcaption></figure>
<p>Being pregnant for the first time, I was absolutely terrified about <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/doulas-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">birth</a> (aren&#8217;t we all?!). I usually (and still do) faint during a routine blood test. So the thought of bringing another human being into the world was beyond scary. For a while, I just avoided thinking about it; denial seemed to be a good default. That changed when a friend mentioned hypnobirthing. She was very much into yoga pre-pregnancy (I wasn&#8217;t), so I was a little sceptical that it would be for me. I thought it was really reserved for the wellbeing and mindfulness crew (not the chocolate and Netflix gang).</p>
<p>But as time went on, and with little to lose, I bought a book, not really expecting much. The book came with some super relaxing tracks to listen to (which could send my husband to sleep within minutes). It was a good start, but I still wasn&#8217;t sure if it would really make a difference. Still, the more I got into the book, the more it made sense. I also related to the author, who was honest, down to earth, and had practical tips and activities which I attempted each week right up until the birth.</p>
<h3>Hypnobirthing during delivery</h3>
<figure id="attachment_196302" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-196302" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-196302" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/HKA-image-resize-1400-x-1000-1400-%C3%97-1000px-41-900x643.png" alt="Pregnancy yoga" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/HKA-image-resize-1400-x-1000-1400-%C3%97-1000px-41-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/HKA-image-resize-1400-x-1000-1400-%C3%97-1000px-41-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/HKA-image-resize-1400-x-1000-1400-%C3%97-1000px-41.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-196302" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Yan Krukau via Pexels</figcaption></figure>
<p>Fast forward to the delivery suite, and it seemed that hypnobirthing came into its own, and I took more on board than I perhaps thought. Any mum will know that you get into your zone when in <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/giving-birth-in-singapore-motivational-mellow-and-push-music-for-your-labour-playlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">labour</a>, and I think the breathing and reframing of the birth away from terrifying to positive with a hypnobirthing approach massively helped me (as well as being fed <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/singapore-mothers-pregnancy-cravings-weird-behaviour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haribo gummy bears</a> on demand for the whole labour). I managed to get through labour without pain relief, something I&#8217;d never imagined possible before, and I definitely credit that to the techniques I learnt.</p>
<p>I should caveat that massively with I know birth without pain relief isn&#8217;t something to aspire to or brag about. Quite frankly, as long as a baby comes into the world healthy, and mum is safe and healthy too, nothing else matters. All mums are absolute champs, pain relief or not. But for me, not being so terrified of the whole birthing experience and thinking about the pain element differently was such a game-changer.</p>
<h3>Baby number 2: incoming!</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m only 9 weeks away from <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/the-life-of-a-second-time-mum-how-birth-order-changes-your-parenting-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">birth number 2</a>, so who knows whether I&#8217;ll be saying the same this time around. I&#8217;m back to listening to those tracks, though, on the off chance that it does help me once again!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">HYPNOBIRTHING IN SINGAPORE – BOOKS AND ONLINE RESOURCES</h2>
<p>Feeling intrigued? If you&#8217;re considering hypnobirthing in Singapore, check out the following resources to help you along the way&#8230;</p>
<h3>1. Hypnobirthing: The Mongan Method – the Natural Approach to a Safe, Easier, More Comfortable Birthing</h3>
<p>Known as the hypnobirthing founder, Marie Mongan knows a thing or two about birth (she&#8217;s had four kids). She&#8217;s the original when it comes to hypnobirthing, and a lot of courses use her approaches (and<a href="https://www.amazon.sg/Hypnobirthing-Natural-Approach-Comfortable-Birthing/dp/0757318371"> this text</a>) to guide the sessions. She compares the experience of hypnobirthing to daydreaming, and how in this calm state, your body’s endorphins kick in and kick out those nasty stress hormones that cause all that pain. This book takes you through the rationale for hypnobirthing, as well as how to find your zone, with loads of practical tips for your birth.</p>
<h3>2. Mindful Hypnobirthing: Hypnosis and Mindfulness Techniques for a Calm and Confident Birth</h3>
<p>A UK take on hypnobirthing, hypnotherapist and experienced doula Sophie Fletcher shares how to have a safe, natural and positive birth in <a href="https://www.amazon.sg/Mindful-Hypnobirthing-Mindfulness-Techniques-Confident/dp/0091954592">this book</a>. This was my go-to during my pregnancy, and there are tracks available online to accompany the course (it&#8217;s pretty relaxing stuff). Sophie is practical in her descriptions, with actions to take after each chapter and a handy checklist.</p>
<h3>3. Hypnobirthing: Practical Ways to Make Your Birth Better</h3>
<p>This one is for the sceptics out there. If you&#8217;re still very much on the fence regarding hypnobirthing, <a href="https://www.amazon.sg/Hypnobirthing-Practical-Ways-Birth-Better/dp/0349419388">this book</a> might just help demystify the concepts with no-nonsense, practical insights and advice. Written by expert hypnobirthing teacher and founder of The Positive Birth Company, Siobhan Miller, it explains why she believes hypnobirthing can make every type of birth a better experience &#8211; from water birth to an unplanned caesarean in theatre. Psst &#8211; check out her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepositivebirthcompany/?hl=en">fab IG account</a> and <a href="https://thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk/digital-pack">resources online</a> too (there&#8217;s a really affordable online course available that comes highly recommended too!)</p>

<p>Thinking about a family campervan holiday around New Zealand’s South Island with your kids? It’s an unforgettable mix of jaw-dropping scenery, tight quarters, and genuine family bonding, with a few quirky challenges thrown in. We spent 8 days exploring the South Island with our three teenagers/pre-teens. Starting in Queenstown and winding our way through fjords, glaciers, and hot springs. Here’s what you need to know before booking, plus our full itinerary and all the tips we wish we had known beforehand.</p>
<h2>Top Tips Before You Go</h2>
<p>1. Register your <a href="https://www.customs.govt.nz/about-us/new-zealand-traveller-declaration-programme/">NZ Traveller Declaration</a> before your flight – it’ll save time at the airport.<br />
2. Download the <a href="https://campermate.com/en">Campermate</a> app – great for campsite recommendations.<br />
3. Get an eSIM – it’s cheaper and more reliable than roaming. We used a company called <a href="http://saily.com">Saily.com</a><br />
4. Check your van’s linen – one doona for five people was a cold surprise! We ended up heading back to the rental company after the first night to collect another two doonas.<br />
5. Pack light but smart – layers and natural fabrics are a must.  I’m a big fan of thin Merino wool t-shirts, breathable and warm.<br />
6. Book earlyfor Milford Sound cruises, zipline, shot over boat, luge and Queenstown restaurants during school holidays. Surprisingly you did not need to book ahead for campsites at this time of year.</p>
<h2>The Good: Freedom, Scenery and Family Bonding</h2>
<figure id="attachment_225017" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225017" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225017" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Campervan-New-Zealand-Chris-Edwards-family-900x643.png" alt="Campervan New Zealand Chris Edwards family" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Campervan-New-Zealand-Chris-Edwards-family-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Campervan-New-Zealand-Chris-Edwards-family-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Campervan-New-Zealand-Chris-Edwards-family.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225017" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Chris Edwards</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s something magical about waking up with no real plan, knowing that your bed, kitchen, and next adventure are all right there on four wheels. It felt like tapping into our long-lost backpacker selves — only this time, with teenagers and snack bars in tow. The freedom of campervan life is hard to beat, and for us, it unlocked a sense of spontaneity and connection that’s hard to find in hotel-based travel.</p>
<p>The South Island itself is the star of the show and a fantastic backdrop for a family campervan holiday. Driving through this landscape feels like cruising through a film set. My son actually shouted out of the van window, “Why is New Zealand so magnificent?!” And truly, the views left us speechless — from the glaciers of Mount Cook to the mystical depths of Milford Sound.</p>
<figure id="attachment_225010" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225010" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225010" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hooker-Valley-Track-campervan-holiday-New-Zealand-with-kids-900x643.png" alt="Hooker Valley Track campervan holiday New Zealand with kids" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hooker-Valley-Track-campervan-holiday-New-Zealand-with-kids-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hooker-Valley-Track-campervan-holiday-New-Zealand-with-kids-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hooker-Valley-Track-campervan-holiday-New-Zealand-with-kids.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225010" class="wp-caption-text">Hiking Hooker Valley Track. Photo: Chris Edwards</figcaption></figure>
<p>We tackled a few hikes on this family campervan holiday (with varying levels of teenage enthusiasm). <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/fiordland/places/fiordland-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/lake-marian-track/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake Marian</a> was a rewarding three-hour trek, and the <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/hooker-valley-track" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hooker Valley Track at Mount Cook</a> was a crowd-pleaser with its glacier views and swinging bridges. These were experiences we likely wouldn’t have had without the flexibility that campervan travel offers. But one of the most surprising joys of the trip was the “trauma bonding” — the unique kind of closeness that comes from all five of you sharing a tiny living space. There’s nowhere to hide when someone sleep talks, snores, or worse&#8230; sleep farts. It’s gross. It’s hilarious. It’s family lore for years to come.</p>
<p>We also traveled with another family — close friends who felt like extended family. This added a fantastic dynamic. The kids had other people to talk to (and argue with).

<h2>The Bad: Cramped Quarters and Van-Life Realities</h2>

<p>A family campervan holiday isn’t for everyone. If you like daily showers, fluffy hotel pillows, or personal space, this kind of travel will challenge you. With five of us in a van, we had to create some ground rules — including the very effective “if you don’t need to be inside, go outside” policy. This helped prevent elbows in faces and maintained some semblance of sanity.</p>
<p>Clothes recycling became a norm. We all wore the same outfits a couple of days in a row. Laundry access was rare, and when we finally reached a house with a washing machine, I nearly hugged it. While we were glad for the experience, our kids definitely voiced their preference for Airbnbs and hotels once or twice.</p>
<h2>The Ugly: Let’s Talk Toilets</h2>
<figure id="attachment_225012" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225012" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225012" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Dumping-campervan-waste-how-to-empty-portaloo-900x643.png" alt="Dumping campervan waste how to empty portaloo" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Dumping-campervan-waste-how-to-empty-portaloo-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Dumping-campervan-waste-how-to-empty-portaloo-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Dumping-campervan-waste-how-to-empty-portaloo.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225012" class="wp-caption-text">How to empty your campervan &#8216;waste&#8217;. Photo: Chris Edwards</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here’s the part no one wants to talk about but absolutely needs to be said: the toilet situation. Yes, campervans come with a small bathroom — including a toilet that you have to manually empty. This is the moment where some potential travelers might check out. But let me reassure you, it’s not as bad as it sounds.</p>
<p>We used the provided &#8220;blue smelly&#8221; chemical sachets, had a strict &#8220;number ones only&#8221; rule (emergencies aside), and mostly relied on campground facilities, which were often surprisingly clean and well-stocked. Only when we were free camping did we face the more rustic options like long-drop toilets or — gulp — nature.</p>
<p>If you’ve been camping before, you’ll find the campervan experience a step up in comfort, with the added bonus of heating, a stove, and your own sink.</p>
<h2>Our 7-Day South Island Campervan Itinerary</h2>

<h3>Day 1: Queenstown to Kingston — A Lakeside Start</h3>
<p>We touched down in Queenstown late in the afternoon, stocked up on essentials at the supermarket, and hit the road for our first night of freedom camping. We stayed at <a href="https://campermate.com/en/location/new-zealand/ota/queenstown/free-campgrounds/kingston-campsite">Kingston Campsite</a>, a &#8220;freedom&#8221; campsite — meaning it was completely free. Facilities were basic: toilets, but no showers or extra amenities. What it lacked in luxury it made up for in beauty. Nestled right by the lake, we were treated to unforgettable sunrises and sunsets that felt like something out of a painting.</p>
<h3>Day 2: Milford Sound — Fjords and Full Facilities</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225020" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225020" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225020" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stunning-Milford-Sound-New-Zealand-Chris-Edwards-900x643.png" alt="Stunning Milford Sound, New Zealand Chris Edwards" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stunning-Milford-Sound-New-Zealand-Chris-Edwards-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stunning-Milford-Sound-New-Zealand-Chris-Edwards-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stunning-Milford-Sound-New-Zealand-Chris-Edwards.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225020" class="wp-caption-text">Stunning Milford Sound, New Zealand. Photo: Chris Edwards</figcaption></figure>
<p>From Kingston, we drove towards the legendary Milford Sound. We had booked ahead to secure a spot at the <a href="https://www.milfordlodge.com/stay/rainforest-campervan-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milford Sound Camping Lodge</a> — the only place you can actually stay in Milford Sound. The campground offered cooking facilities, hot showers, toilets, a cozy lounge room, and a gorgeous outdoor verandah. If you&#8217;re after a little more comfort, cabins are also available. It’s essential to book both your accommodation and your boat cruise around the fjords well in advance, especially during peak periods. A powered site here cost us around $200, and it was worth every cent.</p>
<h3>Day 3: Te Anau and Manapouri — Ping Pong and Lake Views</h3>
<p>After exploring Milford, we drove to Te Anau to restock on groceries and continued on to <a href="https://www.possumlodge.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Possum Lodge</a> in Manapouri. This charming spot became one of our favorite campsites. It had all the comforts we needed — hot showers, a communal kitchen, and the highlight for our kids, a games room complete with a ping pong table (bats and balls included!). There was a welcoming community feel here, with fellow travelers sharing tips, smiles, and the occasional friendly match. A powered site here costs approximately $90.</p>
<h3>Day 4: Tekapo — Hot Springs and the Long Drive</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225027" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225027" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-225027 size-medium" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lakes-Edge-campsite-New-Zealand-campervan-with-family-900x643.png" alt="Lakes Edge campsite NZ campervan with family" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lakes-Edge-campsite-New-Zealand-campervan-with-family-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lakes-Edge-campsite-New-Zealand-campervan-with-family-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lakes-Edge-campsite-New-Zealand-campervan-with-family.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225027" class="wp-caption-text">Clean loos, kitchen facilities and even a trampoline for the kids! Photos: Lakes Edge Holiday Park</figcaption></figure>
<p>This day was our longest driving stretch, clocking in around five hours, but it passed quickly thanks to the stunning scenery and lots of card games. We arrived at <a href="https://lakesedgeholidaypark.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lakes Edge Holiday Park</a> on the shores of Lake Tekapo, right next door to the <a href="https://tekaposprings.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tekapo Hot Springs</a>. The campsite had powered and unpowered sites, a full kitchen, laundry, and a communal lounge. After a long day on the road, soaking in four different hot pools — including an adult-only option — was pure bliss. There was also a small ice skating rink too, which we decided to skip.</p>
<h3>Day 5: Mount Cook National Park — Glacier Dreams</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225008" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225008" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-225008 size-medium" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Chris-Edwards-family-campervan-holiday-New-Zealand-900x643.png" alt="Chris Edwards family campervan holiday NZ" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Chris-Edwards-family-campervan-holiday-New-Zealand-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Chris-Edwards-family-campervan-holiday-New-Zealand-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Chris-Edwards-family-campervan-holiday-New-Zealand.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225008" class="wp-caption-text">Stunning views, everywhere! Photo: Chris Edwards</figcaption></figure>
<p>Day five brought us to one of the trip’s major highlights: camping at the base of Mount Cook’s towering glaciers at <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/aoraki-mount-cook-national-park/things-to-do/white-horse-hill-campground/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White Horse Hill</a> campground. Facilities were minimal, with only toilets and a common shelter area, but the views were absolutely priceless. We hiked the Hooker Valley Track — an easy and breathtaking three-hour return walk with dramatic alpine scenery. At about $65 per family for the night, this was great value &#8211; but also an unforgettable experience.</p>
<h3>Day 6: Lake Ohau and Omarama — Free Camping and Hot Tubs</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225014" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-225014 size-medium" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Omamara-Hot-Springs-New-Zealand-campervan-holiday-with-kids-900x643.png" alt="Omarama Hot Springs NZ campervan holiday with kids" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Omamara-Hot-Springs-New-Zealand-campervan-holiday-with-kids-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Omamara-Hot-Springs-New-Zealand-campervan-holiday-with-kids-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Omamara-Hot-Springs-New-Zealand-campervan-holiday-with-kids.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225014" class="wp-caption-text">Omarama Hot Springs Photo: Chris Edwards</figcaption></figure>
<p>Wanting a more relaxed travel day, we drove just 1.5 hours to Lake Ohau for another night of freedom camping. No facilities here, but the sheer peace and beauty of the lake more than made up for it. We also treated ourselves to a soak in the Omarama Hot Tubs — stunning private tubs overlooking a serene lake — and squeezed in a gentle hike through the Otematata Wetlands, spotting ducks, crazy red wild mushrooms, and even gum trees along the way.</p>
<h3>Day 7: Bannockburn — Wine and Gourmet Feasting</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225028" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225028" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225028" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wine-tasting-in-New-Zealand-900x643.png" alt="Wine tasting in New Zealand" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wine-tasting-in-New-Zealand-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wine-tasting-in-New-Zealand-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wine-tasting-in-New-Zealand.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225028" class="wp-caption-text">You can&#8217;t visit NEw Zealand without wine tasting! Photo: Cloudy Bay</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our last day in the van saw us drive a short 1 hour and 45 minutes to Bannockburn, a charming village near historic Cromwell. We couldn&#8217;t resist stopping at the <a href="https://www.cloudybay.com/en-ww/visit-us/central-otago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudy Bay vineyard</a> for a wine tasting (about $25–$30 per person). This is one of the most well known vineyards in New Zealand. That night, we camped at the <a href="https://www.bannockburnreserve.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bannockburn Domain Campsite</a>. For around $80, we had a powered site with bathroom and kitchen facilities — though we happily ditched the kitchen for an incredible dinner at <a href="https://www.bannockburnhotel.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Bannockburn Hotel</a>. Overlooking golden vineyards and countryside, the meal and wine list were outstanding. A real 10/10.</p>
<h3>Day 8: Cromwell to Arrowtown — Returning the Van</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225018" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225018" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225018" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Campervan-New-Zealand-with-kids-best-campervan-for-families-900x643.png" alt="Campervan New Zealand with kids best campervan for families" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Campervan-New-Zealand-with-kids-best-campervan-for-families-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Campervan-New-Zealand-with-kids-best-campervan-for-families-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Campervan-New-Zealand-with-kids-best-campervan-for-families.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225018" class="wp-caption-text">Thanks for the mems, campervan! Photo: Chris Edwards</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the morning of Day 8, we explored the historic town of <a href="https://www.newzealand.com/sg/cromwell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cromwell</a> before returning our campervan to Queenstown. From there, we picked up a rental car and headed to the gorgeous Arrowtown village, settling into a luxurious Airbnb for three nights — a well-earned treat after a week on the road.</p>
<h3>Days 9–14: Queenstown Adventures</h3>
<p>We spent the rest of our time exploring Queenstown — there’s so much to do here with kids that it deserves its own full guide (coming soon!).</p>
<h2>FAQs: Your Campervan Questions Answered</h2>
<p>Do you have burning questions you want answered before you take the plunge to book the family campervan holiday of a lifetime? Here are some answers to questions I wish I knew to ask before we did a campervan holiday with kids around New Zealand, as well as things I just think you should know:</p>
<h3>What is the best age range for a campervan trip with kids?</h3>
<p>Our kids were 10, 13, and 15 — the perfect age to enjoy hikes, play card games in the van, and appreciate the scenery. The windows in the campervan are quite high, so younger kids might struggle to see out. It&#8217;s also a lot of driving. I&#8217;d recommend it for kids aged 6 to 15. They need to be tall enough to see out the windows at all that beautiful New Zealand scenery, but still flexible enough to enjoy the cozy van life. Young children requiring car seats could be tricky due to space constraints, but not impossible. Most importantly, your kids should enjoy a bit of adventure and not mind being offline — WiFi is patchy in places (a highlight for me)!</p>
<h3>Which company did you rent from, what van model did you choose and why?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225019" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225019" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225019" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nova-Polaris-6-campervan-best-choice-for-family-with-kids-New-Zealand-900x643.png" alt="Nova Polaris 6 campervan best choice for family with kids New Zealand" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nova-Polaris-6-campervan-best-choice-for-family-with-kids-New-Zealand-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nova-Polaris-6-campervan-best-choice-for-family-with-kids-New-Zealand-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nova-Polaris-6-campervan-best-choice-for-family-with-kids-New-Zealand.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225019" class="wp-caption-text">Our campervan &#8211; Star Nova Polaris 6. Photo: Chris Edwards</figcaption></figure>
<p>We chose <a href="https://www.jucy.com/nz/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JUCY</a>, which offers a wide range of reliable and well-equipped vans. We rented the Star Nova Polaris 6, a 6-berth van ideal for a family of five. It featured a double bed above the driver&#8217;s cabin, another at the rear that converted into a sofa and dining area during the day, and a smaller double (really more of a three-quarter bed) created by folding down two facing chairs. This setup allowed the kids to comfortably sit together while driving around New Zealand — ideal for family chats, games, and snack breaks. You can add on additional equipment like extra linens (important to check before driving off!) Friends of ours also hired a small foldable table and camp chairs for outdoors, which was great for afternoon wine time and card games!</p>
<h3>What should I pack?</h3>
<p>Depending on when you go, this list may change &#8211; we went during cooler weather in New Zealand, when the skies were bright blue, leaves were turning orange and the air was super fresh. Check our <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/where-to-buy-winter-kids-clothes-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shopping for cold weather guide</a> for inspo. Essential items for us included thermals, a warm coat, hiking boots, layers, a beanie, Ugg boots (trust me, they were a lifesaver), sunscreen, insect repellent, swimmers, and a compact toiletries kit. Don&#8217;t forget flip flops to wear in the campsite showers! We also packed card games, kindles, binoculars and a travel speaker. The scenery is simply beautiful, so don&#8217;t forget a high quality camera (or your phone of course), as you&#8217;ll be snapping away!</p>
<h3>Are there any safety hazards in the van?</h3>
<p>The kitchen has a gas burner, a sink, and a mini-fridge, all of which are safe if used properly. It’s important to secure everything before driving. Make sure all drawers and loose items are locked down to prevent them from flying around when you’re on the move (something I definitely wish I knew earlier!)</p>
<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
<p>Budget around $500 per day to hire a campervan in New Zealand. Overall, expect to spend between $600–$1000 daily for a family of five, excluding flights. If you&#8217;re travelling with small kids, don&#8217;t forget to check our <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/tips-for-flying-with-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flying with kids guide</a> for tips, too!</p>
<h3>When is the best time to go?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225015" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225015" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stunning-Mount-Cook-from-Hooker-Valley-Track-900x643.png" alt="Stunning Mount Cook from Hooker Valley Track" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stunning-Mount-Cook-from-Hooker-Valley-Track-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stunning-Mount-Cook-from-Hooker-Valley-Track-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stunning-Mount-Cook-from-Hooker-Valley-Track.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225015" class="wp-caption-text">Stunning Mount Cook from Hooker Valley Track.

<p>We traveled in autumn, and the colours were spectacular. Spring and summer in New Zealand are also fantastic options. Winter (June–August) can be breathtaking, but very cold — not ideal unless you&#8217;re ready for true van-life ruggedness.</p>
<h3>Would you do another family campervan holiday?</h3>
<p>Without a doubt! We’re already planning a van trip to Kakadu. While not all of the teenagers are equally enthusiastic, the sense of adventure and family connection we experienced on this trip was truly priceless.</p>

<p>Play is so important for a child&#8217;s development and well-being. And it&#8217;s wonderful that we have facilities like <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/free-water-play-areas-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water parks,</a> <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-parks-for-kids-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature parks</a>, and even <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-playgrounds-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playgrounds</a> peppered around the island for free play.

Because Children&#8217;s Season 2025 is back with an exciting lineup of free and ticketed activities held at the Children&#8217;s Museum Singapore (CMSG) and more.</p>
<p>The annual event, co-presented by the <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/childrens-museum-singapore-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Children&#8217;s Museum Singapore</a> and the Museum Roundtable, is designed to inspire the exploration of culture, heritage, and learning through fun and educational experiences. And who&#8217;s designing it, you ask? Well,  THE KIDS! This year&#8217;s lineup of signature programmes were co-created by CMSG and the students from Lianhua Primary School, together with Playeum. Based on a the criterion of humour, teamwork, and creativity, the panel of children selected from programmes they were pitched to. Later, they worked with the artists by sharing their ideas and feedback. They sure had a hand in shaping the programmes – curated by kids, for kids.</p>

<p>Dads might be content with just a wallet in their pockets, but with these snazzy bags on offer, don&#8217;t be surprised to see him flip like a coin.

<h3>7. For the sentimental dad</h3>

<p>Since the start of the pandemic, we&#8217;ve all been relying on technology a lot more than usual. Some dads, however, were long on the tech bandwagon before the rest of us and have been obsessed with the latest gadgets that can make home living futuristic. Sound familiar? If so, this Father&#8217;s Day, you&#8217;ll want to grab Dad a set of <a href="https://ie.tile.com/product/686614/pro-2-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Tile Pro trackers</a> in case he loses his keys, wallet and other essentials around the house.

<p>If Dad is all about the music, how about a nice speaker with a good bass output and crisp sound while listening to his favourite hits? Check out <a href="https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/speakers/beolit-17?variant=beolit-17-natural" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Bang &amp; Olufsen&#8217;s Beolit 17</a> for a portable and home option.

<h3>10. For the gamer dad</h3>
<p>Is Dad as big of a gamer as the kids are? If so, we&#8217;d suggest a <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-gaming-consoles-for-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">console</a>, but chances are, Dad has probably shelled out for a PS5 or pre-ordered the Nintendo Switch 2. If so, you&#8217;ll want to grab <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/upcoming-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the newest games</a> for him to while his time away. Maybe Dad isn&#8217;t much of an online gamer but prefers board games instead.

<p>To those lucky folks who have a pool at home or a bathtub large enough: we are envious. Still, it doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t dress up at home like it&#8217;s pool day! Plus, living in tropical Singapore means year-round sunshine, so there&#8217;s always a good reason to get Dad a pair of board shorts.

For travel memories, check out this <a href="https://www.amazon.sg/1280x800-Auto-Rotate-Portrait-Landscape-Instantly/dp/B0BR9JG7HP/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?adgrpid=96609649140&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.a67ZMx7rTGCFZSY7b192pW3BDKpD6sHDf52pjROaDOdyUvroicftM2p4zDxbPXezD2-e2dfekWgXKrGnl6OQzzLjsqBQqb5Ug03SAZHm3oo8p_eDexGHDFepAU1rAN3uAmgGb7jRHeIAl4XTWieIK8yZgKCnqwOvpt-71j5TtsWJbvHXPNPV90EXHJPSG6YzMibMEB1dZV0IDaC0Ao79CwU-Mgd-x9be_4N1t5vBwcnnKK2b3wsqpIySxxJktBqmchYNO1y_8NHpJXfjdxsmgJUXV4SZNUWSvnYoMjTHSC4.QdykrLP_XbviHKRBNIbjXTMApVDxMW-4TlXhThsjaXE&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;hvadid=584018033944&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9062512&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=1691090924632933943&amp;hvtargid=kwd-1600085075207&amp;hydadcr=8075_332104&amp;keywords=meural+smart+wifi+photo+frame&amp;qid=1715921671&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">PAIFIEVD WiFi Photo Frame</a>. It&#8217;s easy peasy to upload images from your phone, and it can take centre stage as it&#8217;s standing and wall mountable. Plus, it&#8217;s got loads of fancy features that we think Dad will love – like playlists and ambient light sensors, fancy! Or, if you think Dad might appreciate some inspo for future hols, how about this <a href="https://www.amazon.sg/World-Travel-Irreverent-Anthony-Bourdain/dp/0062802798/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">travel book</a> by intrepid explorer Anthony Bourdain? And if Dad really needs a hol but doesn&#8217;t have time to go overseas, don&#8217;t forget about the whole host of <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/family-friendly-hotel-staycation-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">staycays</a> on your doorstep in Singapore!</p>
<h3>14. For the dad who likes a well-stocked bar</h3>
<figure id="attachment_201005" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-201005" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-201005" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fathers-day-gifts-singapore-thirsty-cheers-dad-pack-900x643.jpg" alt="fathers-day-gifts-singapore-thirsty-cheers-dad-pack" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fathers-day-gifts-singapore-thirsty-cheers-dad-pack-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fathers-day-gifts-singapore-thirsty-cheers-dad-pack-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fathers-day-gifts-singapore-thirsty-cheers-dad-pack.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-201005" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Thirsty</figcaption></figure>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing like having a chilled bevvy at the end of a long day&#8230; especially after a day of daddy daycare over the <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/things-to-do-with-kids-during-school-holidays-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">school hols</a>! We say bring the bar home and let Dad unwind and relax with a tipple in hand from <a href="https://ecproof.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">EC Proof</a>. Stock up on tools of the trade, glassware or Dad&#8217;s favourite spirits. You can&#8217;t go wrong with this.</p>
<p>Psst, if Dad loves a good craft beer, have your pick of four- and six-packs from local breweries like <a href="https://offdaybeer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Off Day Beer</a>, <a href="https://troublebrewing.com/collections/beer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Trouble Brewing</a>, <a href="https://lionbreweryco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lion Brewery</a>, or <a href="https://www.ryepint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Rye &amp; Pint</a>. And what better way to cheer the old man than with a <a href="https://www.thirsty.com.sg/pages/giftbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">custom gift box</a> from Thirsty? It&#8217;s fair to say there&#8217;s plenty to choose from. It&#8217;ll defo show him that you love him beer-y much. Cheers!</p>
<h3>15. For the Dad who loves a good BBQ</h3>

<p>If Dad is the type who loves to stand at the grill to dish out all your sizzling faves (no complaints there), then a set of snazzy BBQ tools is sure to make his day. <a href="https://bbqgrill.store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The BBQ Grill Store</a> is your place to hit up for all the grilling accessories he will need. From multifunctional skewers to heat-resistant BBQ gloves and even heavy-duty Rotisserie kits, the options are endless. Did we mention The BBQ Grill store also has some pretty handy grilling tips and recipes that Dad might love to try out too?</p>
<h3>16. For the Dad who loves camping with the fam</h3>
<figure id="attachment_201002" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-201002" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-201002" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fathers-day-gifts-singapore-camping-tools-900x643.jpg" alt="fathers-day-gifts-singapore-camping-tools" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fathers-day-gifts-singapore-camping-tools-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fathers-day-gifts-singapore-camping-tools-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fathers-day-gifts-singapore-camping-tools.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-201002" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Kampus Production via Pexels</figcaption></figure>
<p>If camping with the fam excites Dad, we know just the pressies he will love to pack for the next camping trip. <a href="https://www.decathlon.sg/c/outdoor-sports/camping-bivouac.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Decathlon</a>, <a href="https://www.camperscorner.com.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Campers’ Corner</a> or <a href="https://www.outdoorlife.com.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Outdoor Life</a> are a camper&#8217;s one-stop-shop for all camping gear and essentials. And the stores stock some pretty cool tools and accessories that could come in handy, from flat-fold silicon storage ware to 2-bedroom camping tents. Our advice? Look through all the gear already at home before hitting the stores to add to the camping stash.</p>
<h3>17. For the dad who likes to sleep in</h3>
<p>Does Dad want to slumber it through Father’s Day? Here’s that perfect gift to surprise him with for his ultimate day of rest. A soft and luxurious bamboo fibre eye mask by <a href="https://www.heveya.sg/products/heveya-bamboo-eyemask" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heveya</a> accompanied with essential oils to ease Dad into blissful sleep and a hypoallergenic bamboo pillow case too. Whoever wants to count sheep with these snazzy ops at hand?</p>

<p>With an over-flowing calendar and tons to do each day, this pressie will have Dad energetic in a jiffy to hit the day with a war footing. The <a href="https://www.theplanettraveller.com/product/wacaco-minipresso-gr-espresso-coffee-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wacaco Minipresso GR Espresso Coffee Maker</a> is not only nifty in design but is lightweight, portable and has a 70 ml water capacity. Best part? Dad can get his kick from any coffee bean/roast of his choice! Did we mention it can even grind coffee beans? So if it&#8217;s a long wait for the kiddos after soccer practice or a long wait in a traffic jam, Dad can reboot with a shot of energy like never before!</p>
<p><strong>Happy Father&#8217;s Day, folks!</strong></p>

<p>We are so excited for this! One of our favourite kids events in Singapore is returning, and entry is absolutely free! This year, step into a world of fun and imagination with four exciting installations inspired by &#8216;Lilo &amp; Stitch&#8217;, perfect for little explorers!</p>
<h2>About the 2025 Gardens by the Bay Children&#8217;s Festival</h2>
<p>This year, the Gardens by the Bay Children’s Festival will feature Disney’s Stitch (from Lilo &amp; Stitch) for the first time! This is a whole Stitch-themed outdoor festival, with large-scale installations and fun play areas. The Children&#8217;s Festival aims to teach kids &#8216;the importance of friendship and family, while learning to embrace and accept themselves for who they are.&#8217;</p>
<h2>Key attractions at Gardens by the Bay Children&#8217;s Festival</h2>
<p>There is lots of fun to be had and photo opps galore at the Children&#8217;s Festival this year. We can&#8217;t wait to &#8216;surf&#8217; down an almost 7-metre tall slide called The Great ‘Ohana Wave! In the Forest of Belonging, kiddos navigate an inflatable forest to uncover hidden messages. In a nod to Stitch’s extraterrestrial origins, little ones can embark on a Space Adventure. Get in on the fun and race swing cars to power up light beams and complete a space mission! The beachside fun of the story is brought to life with Stitch’s Mischief Makers. Here, kids can nurture creativity and sensory awareness through playing with kinetic sand.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we know about the Stitch-themed attractions (most of which are completely FREE):</p>
<h3>The Great ‘Ohana Wave</h3>

<p>Ride into a sun-soaked adventure on a close-to-7-metres-tall slide! Kids can sit in an inflatable tube and wide their way around a Supertree &#8211; super fun! Take care though, this is a big slide designed for kids aged 6 to 12 years old, so there might be some sad faces from little ones who aren&#8217;t big enough to ride.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://honeykidsasia.com/kid-friendly-recipes-anatta/">#DinnerGoals, unlocked: Three simple chef-created recipes that you can cook with the kids</a></p>

<h3>Appetiser: Meatball marinara</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224632" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224632" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/meatball-anatta-900x643.jpg" alt="anatta meatball marinara" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/meatball-anatta-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/meatball-anatta-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/meatball-anatta.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224632" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: ANATTA Culinary Academy</figcaption></figure>
<p>Everyone loves meatballs, and you’ll be surprised at how easy it is to make. The kiddos will have fun making these too, as they get to help mix and shape them.</p>
<p>To make six<strong> meatballs</strong>, you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>112g ground beef, or meat of your choice</li>
<li>14g egg</li>
<li>7g grated parmesan</li>
<li>6g breadcrumbs</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon dried parsley</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon each dried oregano, dried basil, and black pepper</li>
<li>Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>
<p>And for the <strong>marinara sauce</strong>, you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>½ shallot, diced</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
<li>198g crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>50g tomato paste</li>
<li>50g water</li>
<li>2 tablespoon mozzarella</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon each dried basil, dried oregano, and black pepper</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon each sugar and salt</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s start cookin’:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Kid-safe step:</strong> combine all the ingredients into a mixing bowl and mix everything until it’s well combined. Be careful not to overmix it as doing so will make the meatballs tough.</li>
<li><strong>Kid-safe step:</strong> Roll the meat mixture into balls, about one-and-a-half inch big.</li>
<li>Heat a large fry pan on medium high heat, add some olive oil or fat of your choice, and start cooking the meatballs.</li>
<li>Once they’re brown on all sides, remove the meatballs and put them on a baking pan or round tin.</li>
<li>You can start pre-heating the oven to 180°C at this point.</li>
<li>The same pan can be used to prepare the sauce – just add more olive oil into the same pan and put it on medium heat, then add the chopped onions and cook till they’re soft.</li>
<li>Add in the minced garlic and cook until it’s fragrant, followed by the herbs.</li>
<li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and water. Let it simmer for 10 minutes and stir occasionally.</li>
<li><strong>Kid-safe step:</strong> Pour the marinara sauce onto the meatballs in your baking pan or round tin, then sprinkle some shredded mozzarella cheese over. We say, the more the merrier!</li>
<li>Bake for 10 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro-tips from the chef:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a mix of ground beef and pork for extra flavour.</li>
<li>When shaping the meatballs, you may want to get the kids to put on gloves for hygiene purposes. Always make sure they wash their hands thoroughly before and after handling raw meat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Main: Pumpkin gnocchi with nut-free basil pesto</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224633" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224633" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224633" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gnocchi-900x643.jpg" alt="anatta gnocchi" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gnocchi-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gnocchi-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gnocchi.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224633" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: ANATTA Culinary Academy</figcaption></figure>
<p>This recipe puts a twist on the Italian dish by substituting the traditional potato with pumpkin, giving it a fun orange shade that will brighten your kids’ day. ANATTA’s chef also recommends to pair it with a basil pesto that’s nut-free, suitable for most diets!</p>
<p>To make one serving of <strong>pumpkin gnocchi</strong>, you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>102g flour</li>
<li>86g cooked pumpkin</li>
<li>1g salt</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon each salt, black pepper, and nutmeg</li>
</ul>
<p>For the <strong>nut-free basil pesto,</strong> you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>45g olive oil</li>
<li>30g Italian basil leaves</li>
<li>24g canned chickpeas, drained</li>
<li>12g parmesan</li>
<li>1.5 garlic clove</li>
<li>1g salt</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s start cookin’:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blend all the pesto ingredients in a food processor until you get a smooth green paste, then set aside.</li>
<li><strong>Kid-safe step:</strong> Mash the cooked pumpkin until you get a smooth texture. Then, mix in the flour, egg, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.</li>
<li><strong>Kid-safe step:</strong> Knead the mixture until a dough forms, then cling wrap it and let rest for five minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Kid-safe step:</strong> Roll the dough into 1.5cm x 2cm pieces – you have your gnocchi!</li>
<li>Bring a pot of salted water to boil, then drop the gnocchi into it. You’ll know they’re fully cooked when they float to the surface.</li>
<li>Heat a small pan with some olive oil and gently fry your gnocchi until they’re evenly toasted on all sides.</li>
<li><strong>Kid-safe step:</strong> Set your pumpkin gnocchi on a plate with a few tablespoons of pesto, remember to mix before you serve.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro-tips from the chef:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t over knead or be tempted to add more flour to your gnocchi dough as this will result in a rubbery gnocchi. Your dough should feel soft and a little sticky.</li>
<li>You can lightly dust some flour to make handling the gnocchi dough easier for little hands.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dessert: Fudgy brownies</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224634" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224634" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224634" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BROWNIE-900x643.jpg" alt="ANATTA brownie" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BROWNIE-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BROWNIE-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BROWNIE.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224634" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: ANATTA Culinary Academy</figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to brownies, my kid and I are definitely on Team Fudgy. It’s just richer in flavour due to having more chocolate-y goodness over flour. I have a good feeling that this will be my family’s new favourite recipe.</p>
<p>To make a six-inch <strong>brownie</strong>, you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>196g light brown sugar</li>
<li>130g each butter and dark chocolate</li>
<li>128g eggs</li>
<li>70g milk chocolate chunks</li>
<li>60g plain flour, sifted</li>
<li>30g cocoa powder or dark cocoa powder, sifted</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get bakin’:</p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 170°C.</li>
<li>Melt your butter and chocolate on a bain-marie (in a bowl over a pot of simmering water) over medium heat and keep stirring. Remove from heat once the butter and chocolate have completely melted.</li>
<li><strong>Kid-safe step:</strong> Add the sugar and keep whisking until the temperature of the mixture drops below 55°C.</li>
<li><strong>Kid-safe step:</strong> Add in the eggs and whisk till it’s thoroughly combined.</li>
<li><strong>Kid-safe step:</strong> Add the sifted flour and cocoa powder, then mix until there are no visible traces of flour.</li>
<li><strong>Kid-safe step:</strong> Gently fold in the milk chocolate drops – this will give your brownies the awesome gooey texture.</li>
<li>Pour your brownie mixture into a lined six-inch baking tin, then bake for 25 minutes.</li>
<li>Once done, wait patiently (tough, we know!) for it to cool before serving.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro-tip from the chef:</strong> Opt for dark cocoa powder if you prefer a more intense chocolate flavour.</p>
<h3>An exciting kids’ culinary bootcamp is coming your way this school holiday</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://honeykidsasia.com/macbeth-on-roblox-srt/">Have you heard? You can now explore Shakespeare’s Macbeth on Roblox</a></p>
<p>Think you can experience Shakespeare’s plays through theatre productions and movie adaptations? Think again. <a href="https://www.srt.com.sg/">Singapore Repertory Theatre (SRT)</a> has truly outdone itself this time by recreating the world of Shakespeare’s Macbeth in Roblox’s virtual realm!</p>
<h3>Something wicked (and cool) this way comes…</h3>
<p>Macbeth on Roblox is the digital accompaniment for SRT’s Shakespeare in the Park – Macbeth show, created specially for teens. I personally think that this is a fantastic way to introduce Shakespeare to teens and young adults, as it presents the Bard’s Scottish play in a format that’s relevant and engaging for them. Proof that Shakespeare’s plays are anything but boring.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s mentioned that the game is designed with careful reference to Singapore Ministry of Education’s learning outcomes for the Literature in English subject that’s offered in local secondary schools. SRT even worked closely with the National Arts Council to make Macbeth on Roblox a material that teachers can use in the classroom, so students can actually put themselves in the shoes (or boots) of the main character.</p>
<p>I’ll admit it, as a former English literature student myself, I’m super jealous that students now have this learning experience!</p>
<h3>Of course, we had to try it out – and here’s what we think.</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224938" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224938" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224938" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/roblox-900x643.jpg" alt="roblox" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/roblox-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/roblox-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/roblox.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224938" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Singapore Repertory Theatre</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you’re familiar with the plot of Macbeth, you’ll know that there are some violent and scary scenes in the play (the three witches, murder, battle, etc.). As a mum, I’m curious as to how Macbeth on Roblox would present these instances since it has a ‘mild’ maturity label. After all, no mum would be happy with their teens playing a violent game, even if it does offer insights into a literary text they’re studying in school.</p>
<p>Without giving too much of the game away, you enter the game by playing Macbeth’s character, following Lady Macbeth’s instructions to retrieve the dagger and assassinate the king. This is where the game has swordfighting instances, but as stated in the maturity label, it’s mild violence and not gory at all.</p>
<p>But what really captured my attention was the fantastic voice acting, and the fact that the actual lines from the play are used. It really makes learning about Macbeth an immersive experience, as students get to experience the main character’s moral conflict and the gravity of events.</p>

<p>One of our Gen-Z writers, who is a seasoned Roblox player, tried the game out as well and found it quite intuitive. Like me, he was impressed with the voice acting, but remarked that the lines were too long, so much so that he kept skipping them.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s an interesting initiative; and I personally would like to continue playing it (during non-working hours, of course). However, I do think it’s suitable for students in upper secondary due to the mildly violent content and eerieness of the game.</p>
<h3>Macbeth on Roblox is available for play now</h3>
<p>Teens who are into Roblox, or those taking Literature in English, may really enjoy this game. Only Act Two of <a href="https://www.roblox.com/join/5bzlb">Macbeth on Roblox</a> is available for playing right now, but fret not, SRT will be updating the game pretty soon.</p>
<p>But don’t limit the experience to just gaming, make it a family affair by bringing them to catch <a href="https://www.srt.com.sg/show/macbeth/">Shakespeare in the Park – Macbeth</a> too. The show runs on Tuesdays to Sundays at 7.30pm from now till 1 June 2025 in Fort Canning Park, with ticket price starting at $60 per pax.</p>

<p>Father’s Day is coming, and we’re excited to celebrate Dad all day on <strong>Sunday 15 June, 2025</strong>. We’ll be busy prepping a <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/fathers-day-craft-for-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY card</a>, planning an <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/fathers-day-singapore-things-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awesome day of activities</a> and buying <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/fathers-day-gifts-for-dads-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a gift</a> just for him. But we could always do with a hearty portion of some of his favourite dishes too, or maybe a special set menu at his fave restaurant. After all, there&#8217;s no better way to Dad’s heart than grub and drinks to go along with it!</p>

<p>Reward Dad with a nice, cold pint of beer with a bird&#8217;s-eye view this Father&#8217;s Day! Check out the breathtaking Singapore skyline, and treat Dad to a sumptuous 3-course sharing menu. There&#8217;s an assortment of starters, followed by a succulent 30-day grain and koji dry-aged Black Angus ribeye steak (sourced in collaboration with Butcher Box!) Follow this up with one of three exciting upcycled grain and beer-infused dessert innovations. This 3-course sharing menu is available for lunch and dinner on 15 June, pre-order is recommended. Pssst.. try and grab a table outside, if you can, for a panoramic view of Marina Bay!</p>
<p><em><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, 15 June 2025<strong><br />
Where:</strong></em> <em><a href="https://level33.com.sg/whats-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Level 33</a>, 8 Marina Boulevard #33-01, Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 1, Singapore 018981</em></p>
<h3>2. Golf + Grill = Panamericana (plus kids dine FREE on Sundays!)</h3>
<figure id="attachment_187163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187163" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-187163" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Panamericana-900x643.png" alt="Panamericana" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Panamericana-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Panamericana-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Panamericana.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-187163" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Panamericana</figcaption></figure>
<p>Treat dad to sweeping views of the sea and Sentosa Golf Club with a funky lunch or early dinner at <a href="https://www.panamericana.sg/" rel="nofollow">Panamericana</a>, the ultimate grill restaurant. Enviably set within a prime location of the golf club, the lawn tables book out quickly, but it&#8217;s worth it if you can nab a table outside to watch the sunset or feel the sea breeze. This is also a great takeaway option, as the food travels really well (we know, we&#8217;ve tried it!). <strong>Best bit:</strong> <a href="https://www.panamericana.sg/whats-on/kids-dine-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kids under 7 dine free</a> on Sundays with the purchase of a long lunch platter!</p>

<p>We have lots of ideas for <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/breakfast-in-bed-recipes-for-mothers-day/">breakfast in bed</a>, but if Dad&#8217;s an early riser, why not go for a walk along the river and treat him to a big breakfast at our favourite Aussie-inspired cafe, <a href="https://www.boomarang.com.sg/" rel="nofollow">Boomarang</a>. Kids can scoot along the pathways while dad relaxes with a coffee (or a beer&#8230; it&#8217;s 12pm somewhere!) and a guilty pleasure fry-up of sausages, eggs, beans and hash browns.</p>
<p><em><strong>When:</strong> Open 6:00am &#8211; 3:00am daily</em><br />
<em><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.boomarang.com.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Boomarang</a>, 60 Robertson Quay, #01-15 The Quayside, Singapore 238252</em></p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got Teochew parents or in-laws like mine, you&#8217;ll know how much they delight in celebrating with authentic Teochew cuisine. Not that it&#8217;s hard to find them in Singapore, but not many lives up to their discerning tastebuds. This Father&#8217;s Day, <a href="https://zuiyuxuan.zui-teochewcuisine.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zui Yu Xuan Teochew Cuisine</a> makes it easy for us all with set menus starting from $388++ (for four persons). Filled with classic Teochew dishes like the<strong> Teochew Steamed Pomfret</strong> and a platter with favourites like <strong>Ngoh Hiang, Chilled Marinated Jellyfish,</strong> and the iconic <strong>Pig Trotter Terrine</strong>. One dish we always look forward to is the belly-warming <strong>Peppery Pig&#8217;s Stomach and Chicken Soup</strong> ($48++/half chicken, $96++/whole chicken). For a more immersive cultural experience, head to their sister outlet, <a href="https://chuihuaylim.zui-teochewcuisine.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine ,</a> located within a century-old Teochew club, that&#8217;s steeped in elegance and tradition.</p>

<h3>7. A tribute to parenthood at Choon Hoy Parlor</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225325" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225325" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225325" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CHP-2.0-for-fathers-day-900x643.jpg" alt="CHP 2.0 for father's day" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CHP-2.0-for-fathers-day-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CHP-2.0-for-fathers-day-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CHP-2.0-for-fathers-day.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225325" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Choon Hoy Parlor</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a parent, seeing your child work his way to becoming a successful chef is one thing, but imagine them naming one of their restaurants after you! Which is why Choon Hoy Parlor deserves a mention in our Father&#8217;s Day dining list – not just taking the tribute to parenthood to the next level but also serving up good food. Run by Chef Dylan, who also runs The Masses next door, Choon Hoy Parlor celebrates Singapore&#8217;s culinary heritage with what he affectionately calls &#8220;Singapore Soul Food&#8221;. Recently relocated, you&#8217;ll find familiar local favourites like Satay, Rojak, and their signature Kampung Chicken (we love!), all crafted with a refined twist. That&#8217;s not all! We also really like how affordable their set lunch is – three dishes, one soup from just $18.90++. You&#8217;ll even get a choice of lard rice or plain rice. We say, go for the lard rice! Plus, we heard that the restaurant boasts the largest collection of baijiu in Asia, so, if Dad enjoys a drink, house pours starts from $8++ per 20ml.</p>
<p><em><strong>When:</strong> Open daily 11.30am &#8211; 3pm, 5.30pm &#8211; 9.30pm</em><br />

<p>While omakase dining is often associated with high price tags, Ganko Sushi Singapore offers a special <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKUlWiav8H8/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Father’s Day Omakase</a> that lets you indulge in premium Japanese fare without breaking the bank. Despite flying in top-quality ingredients from Japan three times a week, the experience starts at an accessible $98++ per person. ‘Omakase’ translates to “leave it to the chef,” and at Ganko, you’ll be in the expert hands of Chef Kuro, who curates a thoughtful, seasonal menu for each guest. Expect beautifully presented sushi and sashimi, as well as a standout Soumen dish with quail egg yolk and yam cream. To celebrate Dad, all fathers dining in will receive a complimentary Kuromitsu Pudding topped with Black Sesame Ice Cream Monaka—a sweet end to a memorable meal.</p>

<h3>9. Fast cars and slow food at Torno Subito</h3>
<figure id="attachment_225344" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-225344" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-225344" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Torno-Subito-Formula-lunch-900x643.jpg" alt="Torno Subito Formula lunch" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Torno-Subito-Formula-lunch-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Torno-Subito-Formula-lunch-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Torno-Subito-Formula-lunch.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-225344" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Torno Subito</figcaption></figure>
<p>If Dad is a fan of Formula One, he&#8217;s in for a treat at <a href="https://www.tornosubitosg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Torno Subito</a>. Not one, not two, but three F1 cars are on display. Plus they have a three-course set lunch ($68++ per person) that&#8217;s named <a href="https://www.tornosubitosg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TS_Lunch-Menu_May-2025_Digital_FA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formula Lunch, </a>we think this might be the perfect spot to combine Dad&#8217;s love for cars with fine Italian dining! Led by the world-renowned Massimo Bottura, Torno Subito offers a playful, Riviera-inspired take on classic Italian cuisine. Feast on Genovese-style stuffed squid, Slow-cooked pink veal, and pasta like Traditional egg pasta with hand-chopped wagyu ragù. If the experience revs up more than just his appetite, consider picking up &#8220;Slow Food, Fast Cars&#8221;, Massimo Bottura&#8217;s lifestyle and recipe book featuring 85 authentic Italian recipes alongside a peek into his collection of Italian cars, interior design, and art. Our only gripe? The Formula lunch is only available for three days a week, but that just makes it feel all the more exclusive.</p>
<p><em><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday &#8211; Friday, 12pm &#8211; 3pm</em><br />

<p>Artist’s Proof: Singapore at 60 is a landmark exhibition and deeply personal tribute to Singapore’s founding leaders, told not through speeches or textbooks, but through art. Over the past decade, private collector Mr Chong Huai Seng has gathered artworks capturing Singapore’s transformation, from nostalgic street scenes to bold contemporary takes on identity and leadership. In celebration of Singapore’s 60th birthday, this ambitious exhibition features over 90 works by more than 50 artists, offering a fresh perspective of the Singapore story through the creative expressions of local artists from different generations. Featuring 10 new commissions by local artists and 1 brand new music piece, the exhibition underscores Chong’s passion in supporting young artists, seeking to inspire audiences to embrace local contemporary artists and invest in the growing potential of the future of Singapore’s arts through art collecting and patronage.</p>
<p>Chong’s love letter to Singapore traces its journey from a struggling young nation to a global city. Scenes of Singapore’s evolving cityscape unfold through paintings and photographs, while works inspired by Lee Kuan Yew and the founding fathers examine their legacy and impact on nation-building. The exhibition also looks inward, questioning the relationship between artists, the state, and its people.</p>
<p>Presented by The Culture Story and produced by Family Office For Art, Artist’s Proof: Singapore at 60 invites audiences of all ages and backgrounds to experience Singapore through the eyes of artists.</p>

<p>Bhumi &#8211; A disability led dance theatre production</p>
<p>Bhumi, meaning “Earth” in Sanskrit, is a bold, powerful and inclusive new dance work that asks a deeply personal question:</p>
<p>If the world is our home, then why do so many of us still feel left out?</p>
<p>Created by Maya Dance Theatre and its inclusive wing, Diverse Abilities Dance Collective (DADC), Bhumi shines a spotlight on persons with disabilities as they share their lived experiences, challenge societal stereotypes, and reclaim their place within our communities.</p>
<p>Bhumi brings together artists from Indonesia (Gigi Art of Dance, Jakarta), Australia (Liz Lea Creates and The Stellar Company, Canberra), and Singapore (Under the Bridge Collective), with poetry performance theatre artist Verena Tay and Music Direction by Kailin Yong.</p>
<p>Together, we ask:<br />
Can the world be a kind and safe space — truly accepting of all people, of all abilities?</p>
<p>Bhumi is more than a performance — it’s a conversation and call to action. It invites us to slow down, listen, and embrace one another with empathy and understanding to build a truly inclusive society.</p>
<p>Artistic Direction by Kavitha Krishnan in collaboration with the artists.</p>

The tasting menu begins with the Cured Beef Carpaccio, followed by Mini Beef Wellington; Red Wine Braised Chuck Steak; Grilled Denver Steak with sauteed spinach; and a decadent Salted Caramel Truffle.</p>
<p>Diners attending the launch night exclusive on 21 May 2025 will be treated to a complimentary 5-wine pairing from Montes, a renowned Chilean winery, curated to enhance each course. The wine pairing is available at a supplement of $88++ per guest for the remainder of the promotional period.</p>
<p>For those who wish to indulge in the prized Mayura Full-Blood Wagyu while enjoying other dishes in Bedrock Bar &amp; Grill’s repertoire, the Smoked Full-Blood Wagyu Striploin (220g for $128++) and the Full-Blood Wagyu OP Rib (1kg for $320++) both highlight the quality of this esteemed beef.</p>

And there is no shortage of <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/camping-sites-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">camping sites across the island</a>.

<p>This Father’s Day, get the kiddos involved and treat him to a multi-hand massage to relieve those aches and pains. Feet, head, shoulders and back – a little TLC will go a long way.</p>
<h3>30. Make a date with dad</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224847" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/make-a-date-with-dad-fathers-day-things-to-do.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224847" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/make-a-date-with-dad-fathers-day-things-to-do-900x643.png" alt="make a date with dad fathers day things to do" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/make-a-date-with-dad-fathers-day-things-to-do-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/make-a-date-with-dad-fathers-day-things-to-do-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/make-a-date-with-dad-fathers-day-things-to-do.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224847" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Freepik</figcaption></figure>

<p>If you happen to be in the Upper Thomson area at 6am on weekends or 7am on weekdays, you&#8217;ll be able to get a hearty meal at State of Affairs to start your day! You can tuck into breakfast bagels, sandwiches, and even pasta if you&#8217;re feeling more than just a little peckish. The little ones can get the kid&#8217;s meal that comes with beef bolognese and a babyccino – hot milk that has been frothed up with pressurised steam. Even if you&#8217;re not able to get there in the morning, they have islandwide delivery as early as 8am so you won&#8217;t miss out on the breakfast experience.</p>

<h3>3. Average Service</h3>
<p>Not that their service is average but they are all about making average times, intentional. Which means taking the mundane out of early breakfasts and replacing it with good coffee, good food, and good times. Their breakfast sets from $9.90 and comes with a choice of coffee or matcha! Local breakfast gets an upgrade with their in-house kaya truffle butter on sourdough. We still love their Average Chilli Eggs, just egg and sourdough toast, and a fiery kick to get the mornings going.</p>

<p>A cool &#8216;hood deserves a cool cafe, and we&#8217;ve long been fans of the fresh bakes and wonderful coffees at the Eng Hoon branch of Tiong Bahru Bakery. You can&#8217;t go wrong with a perfectly crisp croissant, we say. There are now various locations across the island, and the majority (Funan is the exception) are open by 8am. Winning!</p>

<h3>25. Common Man Coffee Roasters</h3>
<p>Common Man is a little bit more of an upmarket offering in terms of food quality, but never fear – you&#8217;ll fit right in with standard mummy attire of flip flops and food-stained tees. This place is one of our fave places ever for early breakfast in <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/things-to-do-with-teenagers-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Singapore</a>. All that top nosh is matched with delish coffee, and extra points for everything being organic. We sincerely believe it does some of the best pancakes in Singapore! Also: if you love coffee, we recommend ordering the Espresso Blend for your at-home machines.</p>

<p>Head to a Craftsmen Coffee near you for an outstanding brunch menu, fabulous coffee (and some really rather good teas) and one of the best babyccinos around. Plus, they come with a side order of marshmallows. Happy kids = happy parents! The pulled pork burrito is especially yummy – it&#8217;s big enough to share with the kids, so ask for extra plates. Opening times vary, but the Mohamed Sultan Road outlet opens at 7.30am!</p>

<p>In the early-opening stakes, Kith and its various locations is always a winner. Head to Spottiswoode branch with your tribe from 7am, or Millenia Walk for an 7.30am open. Oh, by the way, the Ascott Orchard branch flings its doors open at 6.30am! The early bird might not catch any worms, but it&#8217;s sure to catch a decent coffee and great breakfast!</p>

<p>We love HortPark, but always struggle to find a cafe that is open early nearby. That’s until we spotted Canopy, located right in the park. Not only does it open at 9am on weekends, but it is picture-postcard perfect when it comes to setting and serves the best breakfasts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://honeykidsasia.com/outdoor-learning-myths-international-schools-singapore-mythbusters/">Outdoor learning myths: top schools debunk the biggest misconceptions</a></p>
<p>Education isn’t just about lessons within the four walls of a classroom. More and more often, teachers are looking to the great outdoors to help children of all ages develop their skills in areas such as problem solving, teamwork, imagination and more. Whether you’re clued up on the concept of outdoor learning or you’re not entirely sure what it entails, here&#8217;s your chance to find out more. Here, five experts from some of Singapore’s top schools bust the biggest outdoor learning myths.</p>
<h3>Myth #1: Outdoor learning can only be done if you have sprawling outdoor spaces.</h3>
<p><em>Busted by: Tanglin Trust School</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_224781" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224781" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224781" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outdoor-learning-myths-Tanglin-Trust-School-900x643.jpg" alt="Outdoor learning myths" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outdoor-learning-myths-Tanglin-Trust-School-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outdoor-learning-myths-Tanglin-Trust-School-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outdoor-learning-myths-Tanglin-Trust-School.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224781" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Tanglin Trust School</figcaption></figure>
<p>“Actually, outdoor learning can be meaningful and worthwhile even in small spaces – Tanglin Trust School Infant School’s new Eco Garden is a great example.”</p>
<p>“The Eco Garden maximises the space and features a living wall, as well as a wide variety of plants ranging from scented blooms to textured plants. The plant selection is done intentionally to make outdoor learning in the Eco Garden a sensory-rich experience for children that sparks their curiosity at the same time.”</p>
<p>“Though small, we’ve seen the Eco Garden deliver a powerful learning experience for the Infant School students. From watering plants to composting, and caring for the plants; all these teach students about the ecosystem, biodiversity, and environmental stewardship. You’ll be surprised how a short visit to the Eco Garden can create discussions among children about the different plants and their interconnected roles in the ecosystem. Plus, the act of maintaining the garden instills a sense of responsibility and care in them as well.”</p>
<p>“Last but not least, outdoor learning supports children’s wellbeing as well. The simple act of sitting on a log bench and watching the birds, butterflies, and bees in the Eco Garden provides them with a wholesome break from the hustle and bustle of school life.”</p>

<h3>Myth #2: Outdoor learning? You mean &#8220;survival skills&#8221; class?</h3>
<p><em>Busted by: GESS – International School</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_202117" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-202117" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-202117 size-full" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Resizing-4-3.jpg" alt="outdoor learning myth gess" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Resizing-4-3.jpg 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Resizing-4-3-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Resizing-4-3-768x549.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-202117" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: GESS — International School</figcaption></figure>
<p>“Outdoor learning goes beyond just teaching children about survival skills. Learning outdoors and interacting with nature helps children develop an appreciation for the environment. Besides that, it creates a sense of connection between children and the natural world.</p>
<p>“At GESS – International School, this is very much in line with our DNA to nurture individuals who can contribute to tomorrow’s world. We believe that outdoor learning through <a href="https://www.gess.edu.sg/en/learning/international-preschool-in-singapore" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">our preschool</a>’s Forest School Learning approach teaches children about the importance of respecting our community, environment, individuals, diverse cultures, and more. It’s also a great opportunity for children to develop confidence and boost their self-esteem through hands-on learning exploration in a natural environment.</p>
<p>“Different learning outcomes can be weaved into outdoor learning sessions by GESS’ qualified practitioners. For example: if a child shows interest in creating a shelter, our educator can provide ropes, sticks, and other materials to help them create this.</p>
<p>“Outdoor learning is beneficial for children’s wellbeing too. Nature has been shown to have numerous positive effects, including reducing stress, promoting physical activity, as well as fostering creativity and imagination.”</p>

<h3>Myth #3: Outdoor learning is just play time.</h3>

<p>“At Canadian International School (CIS), outdoor learning (pictured above) is much more than simply letting children play outside. Instead, it’s an engaging, hands-on, inquiry-based teaching program focused on developing life and motor skills, appreciation for the environment and authentic learning experiences. If you think back to your most memorable childhood experiences, I bet most of them were outside!</p>
<p>“Outdoor learning is an integral part of our school’s approach to providing students with a balanced education. In Kindergarten, outdoor learning is inquiry and play-based and takes place in our outdoor learning spaces. In the older grades, it involves lessons in our outdoor centres, field trips, excursion week and Open Minds (hands-on learning experiences in settings such as Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Singapore Art Gallery, Asian Civilisations Museum).</p>
<p>“Our classes are designed to reflect what real life is about. Students get to experience the unknown, learn to problem solve, make connections between what they know and experience, and develop a deep understanding of themselves and the world. They’re encouraged to see things from new perspectives, to think ‘outside the box’ and to explore the ‘what-ifs’ of things around them. We want to inspire our students to ponder things they have never wondered before and to see things that are often overlooked.</p>
<p>“Designed for all ages, outdoor learning at CIS is an extremely rich and authentic experience. It isn’t just about organising fun break times or PE lessons. Rather, it’s about delivering engaging curriculum-based lessons across all subjects beyond the four walls of our classrooms.”</p>

<h3>Myth #4: Outdoor education can only be done outdoors.</h3>
<p><em>Busted by: Head of Outdoor Education, Tanglin Trust School</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_183804" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183804" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-183804 size-medium" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Resizing-7-900x643.jpg" alt="tanglin trust school forest school infant" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Resizing-7-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Resizing-7-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Resizing-7.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-183804" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Tanglin Trust School</figcaption></figure>
<p>“When the pandemic hit Singapore, educators at Tanglin had to be innovative in giving children the necessary exposure to outdoor education. For the most part of 2020, we brought outdoor education ‘in’ to the homes of our learners through online platforms. Local restrictions on group outdoor activities meant that we had to find some creative ways to keep our children connected with the natural world outside our doors. One way is to literally ‘bring the outdoors inside’ by growing plants, vegetables and herbs at home. All you need is a sunny windowsill or perhaps a balcony if you are lucky enough to have one. So many Tanglin families enjoyed the opportunity to turn their balconies or even gardens into a mini vegetable plot at home. Another fun activity we enjoyed during school closures was ‘backyard camping’ in your own home. Not everyone has their own garden, but everyone enjoys making a den or a camp in the living room! We saw some really creative ideas and we were even interviewed by ABC News Australia as the idea of backyard camping spread around the world during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Also, Tanglin is located within Wessex Estate and surrounded by local parks, such as One North Park and the Green Corridor. When Singapore’s Safe Management Measures allowed for groups of five to gather for activities, we brought small groups of children to these areas, instead of field trips. Probably the most significant thing we have learned is how to maximise the use of our own space! We have planted trees and vegetables in the green plots around the edges of the school campus and we even developed our own natural forest school site within the campus. This has proved to be an incredibly useful feature of the campus and student groups from across each school level have really enjoyed exploring the nooks and crannies. The site has attracted a great range of wild birds and butterflies, so this little patch of green is making a real difference. Older students are learning about the importance of biodiversity and it is great to see how smart land management and environmental stewardship on our own site can encourage the development of a healthy and more biodiverse ecosystem.</p>
<p>“Remote learning does not replace the actual experience of on-site field trips but we were able to keep connected with the natural world by conducting outdoor activities together and collaborating remotely using internet platforms such as Zoom and MS Teams. We found that you do not all have to be in the same space in order to actually work or play together. Outdoor learning is all about responding to the environment and working together to solve challenges in a creative way. So while we may not have been able to take groups of students outside to participate in challenging outdoor activities, we did find that we could find creative ways to employ outdoor thinking and collaboration for solving problems and working as a team on our own campus. We have learned to value the natural world that is at our very own doorstep and to see wonder in the small things that before the pandemic we might have ignored or might have gone unnoticed.”</p>

<h3>Myth #5: Outdoor learning is only about overseas or external field trips.</h3>

<p>“As school leaders, we’re increasingly concerned about the physical and emotional wellbeing of today’s children and equipping our students with the skills and competencies they’ll need for the future. Outdoor learning’s benefits are now widely evidenced, acknowledged and accepted. It is at its most potent when it is interwoven within the school curriculum and when it takes place regularly.</p>
<p>“Maths, for example, is all around us: sunflowers boast the Fibonacci sequence, pavement curbs can be used to measure a radius and geometry can be examined by the arc of an in-motion playground swing. Nature is also a huge inspiration for creative writing. At Brighton College, we ask the children to take photos of things that interest them and then use the pictures to write a short story. In our poetry units, we observe and collect sensory images from nature to create original poems.</p>
<p>“A particular favourite of mine involved walking around the school grounds and creating ‘journey sticks’ while learning about Aboriginal Art. Later, in geography, we translated this into a modern map, discussed human and physical features of the landscapes, and mastered our map skills.</p>
<p>“Studies have found taking the academic curriculum outdoors increases a child’s interest in a subject and their motivation to learn. The emotional connections and memories that nature experiences form in the brain help children retain information longer than regular indoor classes. I have certainly found it leads to an increased focus once the explorations are over and we return to the classroom.”</p>

<h3>Myth #6: Children are too easily distracted for outdoor learning.</h3>
<p><em>Busted by: Middle School Student Advisor MYP Action Club Coordinator, Overseas Family School</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_155629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155629" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-155629 size-full" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/OFS-outdoor-learning.jpg" alt="outdoor learning myths ofs" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/OFS-outdoor-learning.jpg 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/OFS-outdoor-learning-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/OFS-outdoor-learning-768x549.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-155629" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Overseas Family School</figcaption></figure>
<p>“Of course children can be easily distracted &#8212; which is why they love outdoor learning so much! Given the opportunity, they jump at it and are enthralled in the process. Helping out at soup kitchens, doing donation drives and growing vegetables are some of the many activities Overseas Family School (OFS) students find appealing and rewarding.</p>
<p>“Our OFS Middle School camps provide multiple opportunities to learn outdoors. The Grade 6s clean the Sembawang beach area, while the Grade 7s visit an elderly home to sing songs, play games and talk to the residents. The Grade 8s visit a soup kitchen where they prepare food, cart boxes, dispose of rubbish and pack cutlery. In all of these activities, distraction is minimal. There is the constant murmur of meaningful conversations taking place while serving the community. Relationships are built up and the seeds of learning-from-doing are taking root in each student.</p>
<p>“Outdoor learning takes place in school hours, too. OFS&#8217;s Middle Years Program (MYP) Action Club, consisting of volunteer students, is always on the lookout for more opportunities. The school’s on-site vegetable garden is a case in point. Our budding horticulturalists, through their journey, have gained a comprehensive gardening knowledge while also developing skills in teamwork, leadership, problem-solving and mindfulness. They’ve also been part of the rewarding journey of growing edibles for the purpose of donation, which is given to a community fridge in Tampines.</p>
<p>“To believe the myth that children are too easily distracted for outdoor learning would be a serious myth-stake.”</p>

<h3>Myth #7: There aren&#8217;t enough benefits to make it worthwhile.</h3>

<figure id="attachment_155630" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155630" style="width: 1400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-155630 size-full" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ISS-outdoor-learning.jpg" alt="outdoor learning myths ISS" width="1400" height="1000" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ISS-outdoor-learning.jpg 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ISS-outdoor-learning-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ISS-outdoor-learning-768x549.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-155630" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: ISS International School</figcaption></figure>
<p>“In my opinion, one of the best ways to promote inquiry in an educational setting is to integrate outdoor learning into the larger scheme of things. The ‘wanderings’ and ‘wondering’ during outdoor learning experiences – be it a school garden, community space or a field trip – lends itself to a natural setting for making observations and posing questions. It takes learning beyond the physical constraints of a classroom and allows for greater physical mobility and enhanced personal and social communication.</p>
<p>“There is now a growing body of research that indicates direct contact with nature has a positive impact on healthy child development and the emotional and physical wellbeing of children and adults.</p>
<p>“As an Art and Science integrator, a large part of my teaching involves fostering observational skills in real-world situations. I am a strong advocate of outdoor learning as I believe outdoor spaces provide authentic contexts for learning and encourage students to use all their senses to make observations. Data collected from the field notes made during observations can then be used to answer and pose questions. I also observe increased engagement and motivation to learn amongst students. Perhaps the less structured approach and a change from the controlled formal setting of a classroom contribute to prosocial behaviour, which leads to enhanced motivation to learn.”</p>

<h3>Myth 8: Outdoor learning? That’s just lessons about nature.</h3>

<p>“At Singapore American School, outdoor learning is far more than just lessons about nature. From field trips in elementary school through to a week-long Interim Semester in high school, students have outdoor learning experiences that offer a variety of perspectives, life-changing moments and skills as they soak up different cultures, people and places.</p>
<p>“In middle school, we offer students an amazing ‘classroom without walls’ (CWW) program, which extends student learning beyond experiences they can gain at school. The primary goal is for students to build positive relationships, trust and cooperation with their peers and teachers by facing unique challenges and experiences outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>“Students further develop their own environmental awareness and cultural competence through participating in activities specific to each trip. For example, eighth-grade students travel to Telunas Beach Resort in Indonesia, and learn about the economy of small fishing villages. Back in the classroom, the lessons learned at CWW support and enhance student learning throughout the rest of the school year.</p>
<p>“Although our students learn valuable skills on their trips, the most important thing they learn will affect them every day for the rest of their lives – the ability to push their own limits and persevere. These experiences take most of our students outside their comfort zones. They are forced to confront some of their fears and find ways to overcome them.</p>
<p>“Outdoor learning is using the outdoors as a venue to learn many different things. It is education in, about, and for the outdoors, not just learning about nature.”</p>

<p>We’re all flat out giving our kids the best education we can, focusing on <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/singapore-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choosing the best schools</a> with the right philosophy and raising smart, well-rounded citizens of tomorrow. However, many of us can easily overlook the importance of instilling the value of <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/where-to-volunteer-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giving our time to help</a> those less fortunate. We&#8217;re talking about <strong>volunteering</strong>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are plenty of volunteer opportunities for kids in Singapore to get involved. After all, real understanding and empathy for others truly come through first-hand experiences. Meeting, connecting, and touching the lives of others is a million times more powerful than learning about poverty in a sterile classroom or making a cash donation.</p>
<p>Want your kids to get involved and give a little back? We’ve done some digging. Here&#8217;s a handy list of philanthropic organisations and charities needing a helping hand. So go on and encourage your kids to volunteer!</p>
<h2>20 charities with volunteer opportunities for children and students in Singapore</h2>

<p>Singapore&#8217;s ageing population has been rising, and most of them are either living alone or put up in care homes. <a href="https://www.lionsbefrienders.org.sg/volunteer-programmes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lion Befrienders</a> help these folks feel less alone by having volunteers assist them in maintaining social integration. Volunteers can look forward to handling tasks such as facilitating activities at the centres, visiting the elderly in their homes, and becoming chaperones to those who need to go for medical appointments. Children below the age of 18 have to be accompanied by a guardian.</p>

<p>Singapore&#8217;s sports scene is always buzzing with options ranging from <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/gymnastic-classes-for-kids-in-singapore/">gymnastics</a> to <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/tennis-lessons-for-kids-in-singapore/">tennis</a>. But there&#8217;s one game that stands out for kids craving a dash of adrenaline and a heap of fun: rugby! If your little ones are itching for more action than a <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/kids-swimming-schools-lessons/">swim</a> and more excitement than a <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/where-to-play-football-in-singapore-for-kids/">soccer match</a>, then rugby is their sport.</p>
<p>Rugby, far from just being about tackles and scrums, is a team sport with various play styles. Take Touch Rugby, for instance; it offers all the thrill with minimal contact, perfect for those seeking a more gentle but equally engaging game. While rugby may not be as famous as football, you&#8217;ll find a vibrant scene in Singapore with numerous clubs dedicated to kids. Here are some top picks where your child can embrace rugby in its diverse forms, regardless of age and gender!</p>

<p>Triangular rice dumplings, resounding drumbeats, and Dragon Boat races? Yes, make no mistake, the annual Dragon Boat Festival or Duan Wu Jie (端午节) is here again. Happening this year on 31 May, Saturday, this is an age-old traditional celebration that remains alive in Singapore, <a href="https://thehoneycombers.com/hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hong Kong</a>, and China. Really, it&#8217;s so much more than the exciting <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/your-cheatsheet-to-renting-a-boat-or-chartering-a-yacht-in-singapore/">boat</a> races or the delicious glutinous rice dumplings. It&#8217;s also a celebration of tradition and honour, or perhaps, it&#8217;s just another excuse for the family to get together. We fill you in on its origins, fun activities to do, and more importantly, where to find those delectable rice dumplings!</p>
<h2 id="origins">The Origins of the Dragon Boat Festival</h2>
<figure id="attachment_224770" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224770" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224770" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dragon-boat-festival-singapore-900x643.jpg" alt="Photo: Studycli.org" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dragon-boat-festival-singapore-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dragon-boat-festival-singapore-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dragon-boat-festival-singapore.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224770" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Visitsingapore.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>As with any Chinese festivals or traditions, the origins story can vary by location and timeline. But one thing that stays the same is its date, the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar. Some beliefs suggest that this was an &#8220;evil day and month&#8221;, and the celebration, with all its customs and rituals, was to drive bad luck away.</p>
<p>In some earlier records, the Dragon Boat Festival was a way to worship the river dragon to ensure good harvest during the summer solstice. Chinese provinces like Jiangsu and Zhejiang, share stories of Wu Zixu, a hero who sought revenge for his family&#8217;s unjust execution, but was tragically forced to his death on this very day. They also tell a story of a devoted daughter during the Eastern Han Dynasty (23 &#8211; 220 A.D.), whose filial piety has inspired temples and traditions in her honour.</p>

<p>But the most popular and known story is that of Qu Yuan (屈原). His association with the Dragon Boat Festival started only in the second century BC. He was a loyal official of the Chu State and a talented Chinese poet who left us with the poem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Sao" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Li Sao (离骚)</a>. During the Warring States period in China, his patriotism was mistaken for treason and he was banished. Seeing his motherland fall into the hands of  the corrupt and overthrown by the Qin army, he threw himself into the Mi Luo river (汨罗江) of the now Northern Hunan province, in despair.</p>
<p>He was so well-loved by the locals that they raced out in their boats to save him. Without any success, they beat on drums to frighten the fishes away and threw rice dumplings into the river to prevent the fishes from eating his body. Over time, this evolved into the Dragon Boat Festival we know, complete with rice dumplings and thunderous sounds from the Dragon Boat races.</p>

<p>Rice dumplings, or <em>Zong Zi (粽子).</em>are a must-have during the Dragon Boat Festival. Wrapped in bamboo leaves, these glutinous rice balls are filled with meats like pork, Chinese sausage, salted duck egg, or even sweet beans. They are held together by strings which sometimes denotes its fillings, and steamed. Depending on the region, Southern Chinese tend to prefer savoury flavours, while those up North prefer the sweet version. These days, restaurants offer innovative takes which can include premium ingredients like truffles or unique ones like ice cream!</p>
<p>Here are some of our favourites!</p>

<p>As parents, we are always on the look out for <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/things-to-do-with-kids-this-weekend-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fun things to do with kids;</a> as pawrents, we do the same. Except, there are just not that many <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/dog-friendly-places-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pet-friendly spots in Singapore</a> where we can sit indoors with our furkids. Singapore is undeniably hot. But even so, I am happy that <a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/news-publications/newsroom/2024/no-additional-sfa-approvals-needed-for-patrons-to-dine-in-with-pets-at-outdoor-refreshment-areas-from-1-jan-2025-updated" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SFA</a> has lightened up regulations since 1 January 2025, such that we can at least enjoy our meals sitting outdoors with our pets. When I learnt about Bailey and Patch – a pet cafe with indoor seating, professional grooming services, a pet-friendly menu, and most importantly, a big heart – I knew I had to check it out. More than just another pet-friendly cafe, Bailey and Patch celebrates diversity and inclusion, using food and the joy of pets to bridge the stigma gap and empower people with disabilities.</p>
<h3>A bright open space at this pet-friendly cafe (with grooming services!)</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224723" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224723" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224723" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-Patch-cafe-seats-900x643.jpg" alt="pet friendly Bailey and Patch cafe seats" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-Patch-cafe-seats-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-Patch-cafe-seats-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-Patch-cafe-seats.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224723" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Bailey and Patch</figcaption></figure>
<p>We love that the space is bright and airy, although it could use a little more air-conditioning. Honestly, it didn&#8217;t stop us from coming back a second time! This 100-seater cafe is located within the Enabling Village, with ample open grounds outdoors for our furkids to sniff around and do their business. If you&#8217;re worried about leakage, you can get nappies at $1.50 per piece at the cafe.</p>

<p>The open layout is easy to navigate with pets or strollers, and there are a couple of booth seats for semi-privacy. For events or full privacy, they can cordon off a space, which fits about 20+ people. There&#8217;s a cute photo-taking spot right at the end, with an orange and white backdrop, a couple of stuffed animal friends, and seats for the main character – our pets.</p>
<h3>Everything you need to know about the pet grooming services (while you enjoy a snack at the cafe)</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224725" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224725" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224725" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-Patch-cafe-grooming-900x643.jpg" alt="Bailey and Patch cafe grooming" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-Patch-cafe-grooming-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-Patch-cafe-grooming-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-Patch-cafe-grooming.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224725" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Bailey and Patch</figcaption></figure>
<p>To the right of the photo spot is where the grooming centre lies. From the inside of the cafe, it&#8217;s just a door, but when you look from the outside, you&#8217;ll see your furkids getting their wash and cut from the display window. You&#8217;ll walk pass the window when you go to the toilet, which is a distance away. Grooming starts from $45 for basic services and we love that we can eat and wait at the same place for our furkid. They offer grooming for a wide range of pets, from dogs and cats, to rabbits, guinea pigs, and even birds! One thing to note, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerUz2u5TtN8rEer8v36tZcHBfZ3qGxjzuliD0sHO9W4sHunw/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">grooming services</a> are only available from Monday &#8211; Sunday, 10.00am &#8211; 6.00pm.</p>

<p>Bailey and Patch serves up Asian food from breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They have the usual <strong>kaya toast and coffee set</strong> ($4.50) for breakfast, and a selection of noodles, rice, and claypot dishes. Some outstanding dishes we tried and loved include the <strong>Signature Golden Seafood Rice Noodles</strong> ($11.80). The savoury soup was very appetising, not a single slurp was left! The <strong>Nasi Lemak with Ayam Berempeh</strong> ($10.80) comes with a huge portion of chicken, beautifully marinated and cooked, make sure to share this if you are a small eater. You can also have this yummy chicken with Fried Rice instead of coconut rice.</p>
<figure id="attachment_224729" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224729" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224729" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-patch-pet-friendly-dining-food-900x643.jpg" alt="Bailey and patch pet friendly dining food" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-patch-pet-friendly-dining-food-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-patch-pet-friendly-dining-food-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-patch-pet-friendly-dining-food.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224729" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you are ordering the <strong>Claypot Sesame Oil Chicken</strong> ($12.80), you have to order rice to go along with it. It is good on its own but it&#8217;s better with rice! The <strong>Tornado Egg Rice</strong> (from $7.80 onwards), which comes with a choice of karaage, pork chop, tempura prawn, luncheon meat, and more is good to look at but is a little too dry for my personal liking. When it comes to snacks, their <strong>Prawn Paste Mid- Joint</strong> ($6.80 for 5 pcs) is a good choice. For kids, the <strong>Kids&#8217; Meal Set</strong> which includes fried rice, a choice of meat, veg, and a drink, is $8.80.</p>
<figure id="attachment_224730" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224730" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224730" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-patch-pet-friendly-cafe-pet-food-900x643.jpg" alt="Bailey and patch pet friendly cafe pet food" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-patch-pet-friendly-cafe-pet-food-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-patch-pet-friendly-cafe-pet-food-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bailey-and-patch-pet-friendly-cafe-pet-food.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224730" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is probably the only place that serves <strong>Pet Cai Fan</strong>. For $11.80, you&#8217;ll get to choose one protein, one side and one garnish, making it a 200g meal. Choices range from the usual beef, pork, and lamb, to the more exotic kangaroo meat. If you&#8217;re looking for snacks, the<strong> fruit platter</strong> ($8.80), <strong>doggie dips</strong> ($2.80), or freshly baked doggie biscuits are great choices.</p>
<h3>Best bit: Bailey and Patch empowers differently-abled people</h3>

<p>Bailey and Patch provides employment opportunities to people with special needs and disabilities. They do so by employing,  training, and developing service staff and groomers, preparing them for future employment in the hospitality and pet service sectors.</p>

<p>It begins with a revolution. A group of downtrodden animals overthrows their owner, seeking to build a utopian society founded on fairness and equality. However, cracks soon appear when Napoleon, a power-hungry and manipulative porker, rises to leadership, using propaganda and violence to consolidate control. The animals quickly find themselves at the mercy of totalitarian tyranny, shackled by the very principles that were meant to set them free.</p>
<p>Based on George Orwell’s political satire Animal Farm, this theatrical adaptation by The Finger Players employs stunning puppetry to illustrate themes of brutality, conflict, and oppression. Written and directed by award-winning theatre veteran Oliver Chong, Animal Farm is a play of discordant harmony, adopting a darker, wittier, and more visceral treatment than the novel’s allegorical approach.</p>

<p>Experience a talking installation paying homage to the glorious plantations that lined Orchard Road. Witness a magnificent sailboat travelling across the Empress Lawn. Touch, feel and create as you go on a pilgrimage of memories through whimsical and playful interactive kinetic installations that take you on a journey through time and space.</p>
<p>Many were once drawn to a place where the winds crossed, where the paths connecting East and West met. There, they traded, made a living, and learned—acquiring knowledge that stretched beyond the borders of their homelands. It was also a safe harbour, as they waited for the monsoon winds to change and carry them onwards to their destinations.</p>
<p>Soon, this place became home, and they reshaped the land to suit their lives. The nurturing trees fed their new ideas and ways of doing things, and with their insatiable and unceasing appetites, the trees made way for a landscape that would be forever changed.</p>

<p>More Than Ever, we seek dialogue.</p>
<p>In 2025, Singapore marks its 60th year of independence. How has our cultural identity evolved, and what can we learn from the evolutions of other cultural narratives and strategies? This conversation series reflects on these questions through the lens of SIFA.</p>
<p>How do we take the measure of the yawning gulf and uncanny symmetries between a self-perceived cultural desert and a key global node? What is the relationship between festival-making and nation-building? What are the hallmarks and impact of Singapore storytelling? Decades into our post-colonial existence, how has our relationship with Asia’s traditions changed? How do we master the art of plugging into global circuits, and what does participation in such circuits mean for art-making in Singapore? What new forms have we invented to make space for difficult conversations? What are the imperatives and challenges of incubating new creative voices in the post-pandemic landscape?</p>
<p>In 1977, the first Singapore Arts Festival kicked off with performances from 77 groups over seven days. In the festival’s 48th year, these six conversations take stock of how far we have travelled, and the journey ahead.</p>

(A long time without singing, you forget the song)</p>
<p>Has all my revelry now stung me blind<br />
Whose now am I, if here no longer mine<br />
But of the whims of winds and ghosts and rivers<br />
A hundred mouths in breath in width and bigger<br />
Than life. I lie beside myself, both quiet, still wet<br />
With shock as two cuts parallel in the same flesh<br />
Prized cub, whose limb from limb I cleft<br />
His head screams in my hands</p>
<p>weish presents a new body of work that draws from an ancient text and incorporates the dying songs and language of her heredity. In this SIFA 2025 commission, she builds upon and looks beyond her signature sonic palette to discover new approaches to storytelling through music.</p>

<p>An old theatre on its last night.<br />
Two actors, A and O, find themselves sharing the stage.<br />
They bicker,<br />
they compete,<br />
they create,<br />
they wonder,<br />
and they</p>
<p>wait…</p>
<p>and wait,</p>
<p>and wait.</p>
<p>“We exist because they exist.”<br />
“Every play has a beginning / And an end / Life is the same.”</p>
<p>But will the audience ever come?<br />
Playful yet meaningful, this production draws inspiration from physical theatre, clowning, absurdist humour and Chinese cross-talk, and challenges us to rethink the bond between performers and spectators.</p>
<p>Waiting for Audience invites you to step into the story and play a key role in completing this unique theatre experience. Join us in celebrating the power of live performance to connect you and me.<br />

<p>A spectacular journey through Singapore’s arts scene.</p>
<p>Join the OG Singapore Boy Hossan Leong in an extraordinary theatrical experience that weaves four decades of artistic evolution through the eyes of someone who lived through it all. This performance of song and storytelling is inspired by Hossan’s personal journey—which mirrors Singapore’s own cultural awakening—from church pianist to becoming one of the nation’s most versatile entertainers.</p>
<p>Be dazzled as Hossan does EVERYTHING—acting, singing, stand-up—taking you on his own exhilarating ride from the 1980s to today. Experience beloved songs reimagined, and hilarious personal anecdotes about the highlights and moments of despair that shape our artistic identity.</p>

<p>Diverse dancers from Southeast Asia and Japan create the imagined world of a colony through dance and movement. Each expressing their personal challenges and aspirations beyond their limitations and comfort zones.</p>
<p>They live in enforced proximity in an urban tenement, yet exist as disparate entities distanced by prejudice, ignorance and fear.</p>
<p>They struggle to make connections despite their differences, while negotiating long-held preconceptions of what it means to be perfect, complete, normal, valuable, human.</p>
<p>In the natural world, the survival of any colony of organisms depends on its ability to function as a single cohesive collective. Differences, diversity, perceived strengths and weaknesses are embraced as necessities – sine qua non – “without which, not.”</p>
<p>And so too it is with our colony.</p>
<p>COLONY – A True Colors Project is the result of an intense collaborative experiment. A blank canvas on which the artistic director, choreographer, composer, film director, dancers and designers organically paint a narrative in dance, music and film.<br />
Unscripted films are seamlessly woven in. They give the audience a peek behind the curtain, revealing the most sacred element of any artist’s creative journey ­– the rehearsal space.</p>

Well, you’ll be surprised to know that this suburban district’s actually pretty kid-friendly – there are plenty of restaurants, activities and even two parks in the vicinity for the kids to run around, too.

<p>We&#8217;ll never get tired of our local breakfast &#8211; kaya toast, half-boiled egg, and coffee. But what sets Great Nanyang apart from its competitor downstairs, is its retro decor, complete with sewing machine, typewriters, T.V. and other memorabilia from the yesteryears. More than eggs and toast, their menu also includes local favourites like Curry Chicken, Prawn Noodles, and Nasi Lemak. We do like the frothy Coconut Coffee; there&#8217;s something satisfying watching it overflow! Bring your furkids and sit outdoors, there&#8217;s a special seat tucked right at the corner that looks like the back of a truck! Cute! Don&#8217; forget to snap some shots at the cathedral-like lobby of Geneo and take a walk at the nature park &#8211; there&#8217;re some swings and an exercise playground there, perfect for kids and furkids!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">If you think that the Maldives is exclusively for honeymooners, think again! Though generally thought of as a romantic destination, this stunningly beautiful island nation dotted across the Indian Ocean has tons of options for families looking for a luxury holiday. Yes, you can definitely do the  Maldives with kids and the whole holiday can be family friendly, if you stay in the right hotel! We&#8217;ve explored all the best options where kids can run on the sand, see dolphins in the wild, go snorkelling and cycling, and of course, enjoy that all-important <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-kids-clubs-hotels-resorts-asia/">kids club</a>. Here is our guide to enjoying this world-renowned, once in a lifetime destination!</p>
<h2>How to get to the Maldives with kids from Singapore</h2>
<figure id="attachment_211945" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-211945" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-211945" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maldives-seaplane-transfer--900x643.png" alt="Maldives seaplane transfer with kids" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maldives-seaplane-transfer--900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maldives-seaplane-transfer--768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maldives-seaplane-transfer-.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-211945" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: globalkey.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s around a 4.5-hour flight to Malé from Singapore, and the key to booking flights is to communicate with your hotel first. Many of the islands in the Maldives can only be reached by seaplane transfer, or by speedboat. Transfers only happen at certain times of day, so if you arrive in Malé on an evening flight, you will need to stay overnight in the capital. We flew via Singapore Airlines and took the morning flight, and we highly recommend this option. You can also transfer via Kuala Lumpur and go with Air Asia, which may be cheaper.</p>
<h2>Where to stay with kids in the Maldives</h2>
<p>All the properties we have chosen are great for holidaying in the Maldives with kids, and offer baby-sitting services as well as family-friendly facilities (cots, playpens, bottle sterilisers, etc.), and a little something extra to make your stay that much more memorable. After all, this is a once-in-a-lifetime destination!</p>
<h3>1. Anantara Dhigu Maldives</h3>
<figure id="attachment_211983" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-211983" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-211983" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anantara-Dhigu-Maldives-900x643.png" alt="Anantara Dhigu Maldives" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anantara-Dhigu-Maldives-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anantara-Dhigu-Maldives-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anantara-Dhigu-Maldives.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-211983" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Anantara Dhigu Maldives</figcaption></figure>
<p>We had the pleasure of staying at the <a href="https://www.anantara.com/en/dhigu-maldives" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Anantara Dhigu Maldives</a> with the family, and we can confirm it was amazing. Offering overwater pool villas, bicycles to explore the island, and numerous restaurants, it was perfect for our family of five. The hotel’s Kids Club is shaped as a Dhoni, a traditional Maldivian boat, and had the kids dreaming of becoming pirates! This resort has a bonus of connecting islands, with two more associated resorts only a boat ride away, which means you have access to a wider range of restaurant options. We especially loved the reef on Gilhifushi Island, complete with sun beds and a bar, and perfect for family snorkelling experiences every morning!</p>
<h3>2. Avani+ Fares Maldives</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212013" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212013" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-212013" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Avani-Fares-Maldives-with-kids-from-Singapore-900x643.png" alt="Avani Fares Maldives with kids from Singapore" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Avani-Fares-Maldives-with-kids-from-Singapore-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Avani-Fares-Maldives-with-kids-from-Singapore-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Avani-Fares-Maldives-with-kids-from-Singapore.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212013" class="wp-caption-text">Photos: Avani+ Fares Maldives</figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine a kids-only restaurant, where the kids can wear chef&#8217;s hats and aprons and create their own culinary masterpieces (no parents allowed!) <a href="https://www.avanihotels.com/en/fares-maldives" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Avani+ Fares Maldives</a> is a kids paradise, with a super cute kids club. There is also a teens-only club complete with pool table, game stations, and adventures and activities just for teens. We love Avani as a (slightly) more affordable option on the Maldivian holiday scale, without sacrificing the awe and wonder of being in the Maldives.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all about the villas at <a href="https://soneva.com/resorts/soneva-fushi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Soneva Fushi</a>, with incredible two-storey accommodation that even includes your own private pool and waterslide into the sea. If you&#8217;re looking for arguably the largest playground in South Asia, we&#8217;ve found it. At the size of six tennis courts, the dedicated playground at Soneva Fushi is a paradise for kiddos, with two pools, a water slide and rooms for dressing up, Lego, music and more. Everything is overseen by qualified childminders, while older children and teens also have access to Soneva Academy.</p>
<h3>4. One&amp;Only Reethi Rah<b></b></h3>
<figure id="attachment_211984" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-211984" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-211984" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/OneOnly-Reethi-Rah-Maldives-with-kids-900x643.png" alt="One&amp;Only Reethi Rah Maldives with kids" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/OneOnly-Reethi-Rah-Maldives-with-kids-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/OneOnly-Reethi-Rah-Maldives-with-kids-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/OneOnly-Reethi-Rah-Maldives-with-kids.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-211984" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: One &amp; Only Reethi Rah Maldives</figcaption></figure>
<p><b></b>Family-friendly doesn’t even begin to describe <a href="https://www.oneandonlyresorts.com/reethi-rah" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">One&amp;Only Reethi Rah</a>. Its proximity to Male make it an easy journey for families with babies or younger children. Once on the property, children of all ages (from toddlers to teenagers) will be overwhelmed by all the activities on offer. Tennis and swimming lessons, sushi-making, and lifeguard training are all on the list! The kiddos will also love the shark safaris, hand line fishing excursions and turtle adventures. Children and infant meals are also on their own special menu, no need to worry about bringing too much formula! To make the experience even more memorable, kids can make friends of their own age group –  OneTribe is for nine to 11-year-olds while KidsOnly is for four to nine-year-olds (two and three-year-olds are welcome, but must be accompanied by a nanny).</p>
<h3>5. Six Senses Kanahura Maldives</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212012" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212012" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-212012" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maldives-with-kids-from-Singapore-900x643.png" alt="Maldives with kids from Singapore" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maldives-with-kids-from-Singapore-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maldives-with-kids-from-Singapore-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maldives-with-kids-from-Singapore.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212012" class="wp-caption-text">Photos: Six Senses Kanahura Maldives</figcaption></figure>

Kids receive a welcome gift pack and a farewell present as a souvenir of their stay at Kanuhura – but we won’t tell you what’s inside so as to not ruin the surprise!</p>
<h3>6. Six Senses Laamu</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212014" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-212014" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Six-Senses-Laamu-Maldives-900x643.png" alt="Six Senses Laamu Maldives" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Six-Senses-Laamu-Maldives-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Six-Senses-Laamu-Maldives-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Six-Senses-Laamu-Maldives.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212014" class="wp-caption-text">Photos: Six Senses Laamu Maldives</figcaption></figure>

There&#8217;s both indoor and outdoor games, treasure hunting, and cooking classes available. The kids will also be spending A LOT of time in the hotel’s chocolate and ice cream rooms – an endless flow of chocolate and ice cream all day, every day? Yes, please!</p>
<h3>7. Four Seasons Landaa Girravaru</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212015" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-212015" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/four-seasons-maldives-with-kids-900x643.png" alt="four seasons maldives with kids" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/four-seasons-maldives-with-kids-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/four-seasons-maldives-with-kids-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/four-seasons-maldives-with-kids.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212015" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Four Seasons Maldives</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here’s a hotel kids (and parents) will have a hard time leaving! <a href="https://www.fourseasons.com/maldiveslg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Four Seasons Landaa Girravaru’s</a> Kuda Veela Kid’s Club has your typical ‘wear them out so they fall asleep instantly’ activities, but also educational ones. Children can build their own coral reef and feed baby clownfish, enabling them to understand the importance of preserving our environment. Kids receive welcome amenities and complimentary toiletries. For those of us who are extra-cautious, the hotel can provide items to childproof your room &#8211; it&#8217;s great to have peace of mind! And just look at the resort&#8217;s amazing seaplane.</p>
<h2>Things to do in the Maldives with kids</h2>
<p>Every resort offers different activities, but there are some key highlights you shouldn&#8217;t miss!</p>
<h3>1. Snorkelling / Diving</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212095" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212095" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-212095" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/snorkelling-Maldives-900x643.png" alt="snorkelling Maldives" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/snorkelling-Maldives-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/snorkelling-Maldives-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/snorkelling-Maldives.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212095" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Six Senses Laamu</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you are a family of keen divers or just enjoy <a href="https://traveltriangle.com/blog/snorkeling-in-maldives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">snorkelling</a> at the surface, the Maldives is a haven to sealife with around 2,500 incredible coral reefs. Many of these are home reefs to the hotels that are inhabiting the islands, so you can snorkel straight from the sand of your hotel! We recommend buying your own snorkelling gear with a high quality mask as there is so much to see &#8211; everything from turtles to tropical fish and eagle rays. For the serious diver, hop on a <a href="https://www.liveaboard.com/search/maldives?snorkeling=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">liveaboard boat</a> and visit a range of dive sites.</p>
<h3>2. Dolphin cruise</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212016" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212016" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-212016" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dolphin-cruise-in-the-maldives-900x643.png" alt="dolphin cruise in the maldives" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dolphin-cruise-in-the-maldives-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dolphin-cruise-in-the-maldives-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dolphin-cruise-in-the-maldives.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212016" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: naturetrek.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Spinner dolphins are the most popular species you can spot in the Maldives, and it really is a magical experience. We saw a pod of up to 100 dolphins, all breaching together and swimming against the wake of the boat. It&#8217;s an incredible sight. Some of the hotels include a swimming experience, where guests can snorkel close to the dolphins (no touching though, as they are wild animals).</p>
<h3>3. Watersports and jet skiing</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212096" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212096" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-212096" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/watersports-in-Maldives-for-kids-900x643.png" alt="watersports in Maldives for kids" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/watersports-in-Maldives-for-kids-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/watersports-in-Maldives-for-kids-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/watersports-in-Maldives-for-kids.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212096" class="wp-caption-text">Photos: Trip Advisor</figcaption></figure>
<p>Surfing, parasailing, kayaking, water skiing and wakeboarding &#8211; name a <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/water-sports-for-kids-in-singapore/">water sport</a>, and you can probably try your hand at it in the Maldives. Many of the hotels own speedboats and water sports equipment for you to hire, and lessons are also available. There&#8217;s something pretty special about the thought of carving up the aquamarine water on a jet ski, although it does kind of ruin the serenity and can disturb the wild life, so we gave this a miss. If you&#8217;re staying in the Maldives with kids, you&#8217;ll want to do a family kayak. So fun, and definitely core memories made!</p>
<h3>4. Stargazing</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212017" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212017" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-212017" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Stargazing-in-Maldives-Eager-Journeys-900x643.png" alt="Stargazing in Maldives Eager Journeys" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Stargazing-in-Maldives-Eager-Journeys-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Stargazing-in-Maldives-Eager-Journeys-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Stargazing-in-Maldives-Eager-Journeys.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212017" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Eager Journeys</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://eagerjourneys.com/stargazing-in-the-maldives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stargazing</a> in the Maldives is a must. Being far away from populated cities on a island in the middle of the Indian Ocean means that when the sun sets (which is a stunning sight in itself as the sun sinks into the sea!) the stars really get to shine. It&#8217;s location on the equator means that you can see both the Southern and Northern consteallations, which is pretty spectacular! The dry season is November to April, and this is when the skies are clearest. Some of the hotels even offer stargazing educational programs and observatories – such as the <a href="https://www.anantara.com/en/kihavah-maldives/experiences/stargazing-at-sky-bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Anantara Kihavah</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Spa time</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212098" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212098" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-212098" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Spa-in-the-Maldives-900x643.png" alt="Spa in the Maldives" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Spa-in-the-Maldives-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Spa-in-the-Maldives-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Spa-in-the-Maldives.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212098" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Vakkaru Maldives</figcaption></figure>
<p>If there is one place that offers <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/skin-care-beauty-products-for-mums/">spectacular spa experiences</a>, it&#8217;s the Maldives. Some of the beds even have glass viewing windows over the ocean so you can see fish swim by while you&#8217;re relaxing. Many of the spas offer open air spa huts or private beach set ups, so you can feel the sea breeze while you&#8217;re enjoying your massage or facial. Check with your hotel about their spa options, as they&#8217;ll vary island to island.</p>
<h3>6. Culinary journeys and celebrity chef restaurants</h3>
<figure id="attachment_212099" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212099" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-212099" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/The-Ledge-by-Dave-Pynt-Maldives-Burnt-Ends-900x643.png" alt="The Ledge by Dave Pynt Maldives Burnt Ends" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/The-Ledge-by-Dave-Pynt-Maldives-Burnt-Ends-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/The-Ledge-by-Dave-Pynt-Maldives-Burnt-Ends-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/The-Ledge-by-Dave-Pynt-Maldives-Burnt-Ends.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212099" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: The Ledge</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our very own Burnt Ends chef extraordinaire, Dave Pynt, has set up a restaurant called <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/mleonwa-waldorf-astoria-maldives-ithaafushi/dining/the-ledge-by-dave-pynt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">&#8216;The Ledge&#8217;</a> at the Waldorf Astoria Maldives, and he&#8217;s not the only awarded chef to do so. You&#8217;ll often be offered unique dining experiences, if you know where to book. Many of the hotels offer specially curated beach picnics and private dining experiences, including catch and cook where you go fishing and cook what you catch!</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy the Maldives with kids, and unlock core family memories!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://honeykidsasia.com/legoland-malaysia-guide/">The tried-and-tested HoneyKids&#8217; family guide to Legoland Malaysia</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.legoland.com.my/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Legoland Malaysia</a> is a long-time favourite destination for families in Singapore. If you have kids (or a husband) crazy about all things LEGO, this is one pilgrimage you must make. We went to the park ourselves to create this Legoland Malaysia guide: the inside scoop on how to have a great visit with the family! Just a drive across the causeway, and there&#8217;s loads of lego fun in store for both children and adults! It&#8217;s doable in a day so that you can experience theme park fun in a jiffy.</p>
<p>If you have kids (or a partner) who&#8217;s crazy about <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/lego-guide-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all things LEGO</a>, then <a href="https://www.legoland.com.my/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legoland Malaysia</a> is a pilgrimage you must make. Not only is it near (less than one hour&#8217;s drive on a good day), but the theme park has lots to offer besides rides. My family&#8217;s a big fan of this theme park, so much so that we got ourselves <strong>annual passes</strong> for unlimited visits all year round.</p>
<p>Read on for my personal guide to Legoland Malaysia, along with important info like height restrictions for rides, the available family amenities, and more practical tips for when <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/directasia-singapore-travel-tips-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travelling with kids</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">All you need to know about Legoland Malaysia</h2>
<p>There are actually three different parks within Legoland Malaysia: the <a href="https://www.legoland.com.my/explore/theme-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">theme park</a>, <a href="https://www.legoland.com.my/explore/water-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">water park</a>, and <a href="https://www.legoland.com.my/explore/sea-life-aquarium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sea Life Aquarium</a>. Each park requires individual ticket purchase; or you can save up to 22% by getting double-park (theme park and aquarium) and triple-park passes.</p>
<p>This applies to the annual passes as well, with the single-park annual pass applicable to the theme park only; double-park for the theme park and aquarium; and triple-park for all parks.</p>
<h3>Legoland Malaysia theme park</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224424" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224424" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224424" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/legoland-water-900x643.jpg" alt="legoland ride" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/legoland-water-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/legoland-water-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/legoland-water.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224424" class="wp-caption-text">The Aquazone Wave Racers at LEGO Technic.<br />Photography: Esther Chung for HoneyKids Asia</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Themed areas</h3>
<p>Legoland Malaysia&#8217;s theme park is split into eight themed areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Beginning</li>
<li>LEGO City</li>
<li>Land of Adventure</li>
<li>Imagination</li>
<li>LEGO Ninjago World</li>
<li>LEGO Kingdoms</li>
<li>Miniland</li>
<li>LEGO Technic</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re travelling with young kids who are around 105cm in height or shorter, I highly recommend you start your Legoland Malaysia theme park journey in the order stated above. This is because LEGO City, Land of Adventure, and Imagination has more rides that kids 105cm-tall or below can take by themselves, or with an accompanying adult. Time is of the essence, especially if you&#8217;re travelling with kids (read: wake windows, meal times, snack time, toilet breaks, etc.), so make the most of your time at the theme park by hopping on all the young-kid-friendly rides first.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> Turn right once you&#8217;ve passed the ticket gantry — this should bring you to LEGO City. After you&#8217;re done with the rides there, you can then work your way through the park in an anti-clockwise manner to go to Land of Adventure, followed by Imagination, and so on.

<h3>Minimum height required for each ride</h3>
<p>Height restriction is a deal breaker for me when it comes to visiting theme parks with the kids. The tickets aren&#8217;t cheap, and while there may be attractions or play areas, the highlights are always the rides for me. In my opinion, Legoland Malaysia theme park is worth visiting if you have a kid who&#8217;s at least 95cm tall. While my kid of that height didn&#8217;t get to try all the rides, it worked out fine as the ones that have a higher height requirement are mostly too &#8216;extreme&#8217; for them anyway.</p>
<p>Here are the minimum height for the rides, as of date of publishing:</p>
<h4>LEGO City</h4>
<ul>

<h3>Playgrounds and activity centres</h3>
<p>What I love the most about Legoland Malaysia theme park is that it has lots of themed playgrounds that&#8217;s open to kids of all ages and height to enjoy. These are a godsend if one (or two) of your children has yet to hit the minimum height. While the older (and taller) sibling hit the thrilling rides, the little ones still get to have fun at these cool playgrounds. Plus, some of them are located really near the theme park restaurants — great distractions if the kids need to wait for their food, or to wait for us to finish ours!</p>
<figure id="attachment_224432" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224432" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224432" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/forest-900x643.jpg" alt="lego forestmen" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/forest-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/forest-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/forest.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224432" class="wp-caption-text">The Forestmen&#8217;s Hideout playground.<br />Photography: Esther Chung for HoneyKids Asia</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here are the playgrounds at each themed area:</p>
<ul>
<li>LEGO City &#8211; The Shipyard, a marine adventure-inspired playground with a ship-shaped play system.</li>
<li>Land of Adventure &#8211; Pharoah&#8217;s Adventure, an indoor playground with soft foam ball shooting machines.</li>
<li>Imagination &#8211; Duplo Playtown, a colourful sheltered play area with gentle slides and play structures — best for bubs who just started walking!</li>
<li>LEGO Ninjago World &#8211; Cole&#8217;s Rock Climb, not exactly a playground, but a easy climbing wall that can keep kids entertained if the queue for LEGO Ninjago The Ride gets too long.</li>
<li>Land of Adventure &#8211; The Forestmen&#8217;s Hideout, a multi-level playground with lots of slides and treetop climbs — and my kid&#8217;s personal favourite!</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_224433" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224433" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224433" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/academy-900x643.jpg" alt="lego academy" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/academy-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/academy-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/academy.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224433" class="wp-caption-text">The LEGO Academy.<br />Photography: Esther Chung for HoneyKids Asia</figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from playgrounds, there are also what I&#8217;d call &#8216;activity centres&#8217; where kids can play away from the heat and rain (bliss!). Since this is Legoland, everything — including the play materials in these activity centres — are centred on LEGO. We didn&#8217;t manage to try out all the activities, but here&#8217;s what each centre offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build &amp; Test: as the name suggests, this is a place to for kids to let their imaginations run wild, build whatever they can think of, and put their creations to the test.</li>
<li>LEGO Academy: kiddos get to pick and build a LEGO structure of their choice based on a manual.</li>
<li>LEGO Mindstorms: kids get to learn how to build LEGO robots through these guided workshops.</li>
<li>Rebuild the World: choose your themed station and build a masterpiece. Little hands can participate too at a Duplo booth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Don&#8217;t forget to catch a show</h3>
<p>You and your kids won&#8217;t want to miss these, especially if they&#8217;re big fans of LEGO movies. We like the <a href="https://www.legoland.com.my/explore/shows-entertainment/lego-ninjago-the-realm-of-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LEGO Ninjago live show</a> that&#8217;s performed at LEGO City Stage, presented in the form of a Japanese puppet show. There are also <a href="https://www.legoland.com.my/explore/theme-park/rides-attractions/lego-studios-4d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">immersive 4D shows</a> you can watch at LEGO Studios throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Cameras at the ready</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224434" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224434" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224434" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/miniland-900x643.jpg" alt="miniland" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/miniland-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/miniland-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/miniland.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224434" class="wp-caption-text">A mini version of the famous Siti Khadijah Market in Kota Bharu, Kelantan.<br />Photography: Esther Chung for HoneyKids Asia</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, how can we forget about snapping some precious family memories. The whole theme park is full of photo spots!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also want to factor in some time to check out Miniland. Don&#8217;t underestimate this themed area, trust me when I tell you that your kids would be so engrossed by all the little structures of iconic buildings, you won&#8217;t even realise you&#8217;ve spent an hour there (#truestory). What makes Legoland Malaysia extra special is that it has a mini representation of each Malaysian state, and even the different types of <em>kampung</em> houses.</p>
<h3>Legoland Malaysia water park</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-187502" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Legoland-Malaysia-Waterpark-slides-900x643.png" alt="" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Legoland-Malaysia-Waterpark-slides-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Legoland-Malaysia-Waterpark-slides-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Legoland-Malaysia-Waterpark-slides.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Time to cool off? Head to the Legoland Water Park for hours of fun heading down slides, swimming in the wave pool, and drifting along building your very own raft. Our top tips would be to bring your own towels, and if you have little ones with you, you&#8217;ll need to dress them in <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-reusable-diapers-swim-nappies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waterproof swim nappies</a>.</p>
<h4>Minimum height required for each water slide and ride</h4>
<ul>
<li>Build-A-Raft River &#8211; no height restriction, but kids below 107cm must be accompanied by an adult</li>
<li>LEGO Wave Pool &#8211; no height restriction, but kids below 107cm must be accompanied by an adult</li>
<li>Duplo Splash Safari &#8211; 91cm, accompanied by an adult</li>
<li>Joker Soaker &#8211; 91cm, accompanied by an adult</li>
<li>Red Rush &#8211; 102cm</li>
<li>Splash Out &#8211; 102cm</li>
<li>Twin Chaser &#8211; 102cm</li>
<li>Brick Blaster &#8211; 107cm</li>
<li>Legoland Slide Racers &#8211; 107cm</li>
<li>Splash &amp; Swirl &#8211; 107cm</li>
<li>Tidal Tube &#8211; 107cm</li>
<li>Wave Rider &#8211; 107cm</li>
</ul>
<p>Play areas with no height restriction: Build-A-Boat and Imagination Station.</p>
<h3>Sea Life Aquarium</h3>
<figure id="attachment_187480" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187480" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-187480" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Legoland-Malaysia-theme-park-Aquarium-tank-900x643.png" alt="Legoland Malaysia theme park Aquarium tank" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Legoland-Malaysia-theme-park-Aquarium-tank-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Legoland-Malaysia-theme-park-Aquarium-tank-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Legoland-Malaysia-theme-park-Aquarium-tank.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-187480" class="wp-caption-text">Be wowed by 13,000 sea creatures! Image: Honeykids Asia</figcaption></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s not all about rides and thrills at Legoland Malaysia — say hello to Sea Life Aquarium. Here, you can discover sea creatures up close and dive into an amazing underwater world. Be engaged and inspired to learn, love and care for the ocean through Sea Life Malaysia&#8217;s compelling storytelling. Showcasing more than 25 display tanks in 11 habitat zones, featuring 13,000 sea creatures from 120 species, so book out at least a few hours to explore!</p>
<h3>F&amp;B options at Legoland Malaysia</h3>
<p>Little tummies get hungry quicker than usual, especially when there are so many rides and things to do. Fret not, Legoland Malaysia has six restaurants and two snack kiosks in its theme park; and two restaurants in the water park. These food stops serve everything from pizzas to local delights. Note that you&#8217;re not allowed to bring outside food into the park (they&#8217;re pretty strict with the bag checks); but baby food and water are fine.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> Pack a huge tumbler of water each, as mineral water isn&#8217;t cheap in the theme park.</p>
<figure id="attachment_224435" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224435" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224435" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/legoland-pizza-900x643.jpg" alt="legoland pizza" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/legoland-pizza-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/legoland-pizza-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/legoland-pizza.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224435" class="wp-caption-text">Pizza Mania restaurant in Legoland Malaysia.<br />Photography: Legoland Malaysia</figcaption></figure>
<p>For variety, Market Restaurant in LEGO City is your best bet in the theme park. However, if you&#8217;re an annual pass holder for which the per-entry rule doesn&#8217;t apply to you, your family will get more options in the Mall of Medini, which is just a short walk outside of the theme park. There&#8217;s The Chicken Rice Shop, The Grocer&#8217;s Kitchen and S.WINE Deli (both located within Ben&#8217;s Independent Grocer) for wholesome western fare, as well as Jubilee&#8217;s Nanyang Coffee and Rizwan by Nasi Lemak Cincai for local food.</p>
<p>My personal picks are The Chicken Rice Shop and The Grocer&#8217;s Kitchen (love the roast chicken!).</p>
<h3>Family amenities at Legoland Malaysia</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224436" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224436" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/baby-room-900x643.jpg" alt="legoland baby room" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/baby-room-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/baby-room-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/baby-room.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224436" class="wp-caption-text">The spacious baby room in Legoland Malaysia theme park.<br />Photography: Esther Chung for HoneyKids Asia</figcaption></figure>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised by how spacious the baby room was in Legoland Malaysia theme park. This is located within the Imagination themed area, right opposite the Duplo Playtown. There&#8217;s ample space for little ones to move around, comfortable chairs to nurse, a large pantry for formula and food preparation, and two family toilets for the toilet-trained kiddos.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Is it worth it to get an annual pass for Legoland Malaysia?</h3>
<p>As a mum of a preschooler and one soon-to-be toddler, the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Put it this way: a day ticket for the theme park is RM199 per child (aged three to 11) and RM249 per adult. A single-park annual pass is RM249 per child and RM299 per adult. The difference is RM50, but you get unlimited entry for a whole year (blackout dates apply for single-park and double-park passes).</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t plan to revisit Legoland Malaysia after this trip, you have the flexibility of making it a two-day excursion without having to pay double. Depending on the time of year you&#8217;re visiting, you may actually need more than one day to fully conquer the park with the kids in tow. As my family visited theme park during the rainy season, we planned it as a two-day trip so the kids can enjoy their Legoland experience to the max.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> Visit on Tuesdays and selected Wednesdays (non-Malaysian school holiday and non-public holiday) to score 50% off day ticket prices. You&#8217;ll also want to keep an eye out for promos, as I managed to snag the annual passes for my family at the same price as the day tickets!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The important info: transport and accommodation for Legoland Malaysia</h2>
<figure id="attachment_201315" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-201315" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-201315" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Legoland-Malaysia-900x643.png" alt="Legoland Malaysia" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Legoland-Malaysia-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Legoland-Malaysia-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Legoland-Malaysia.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-201315" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Legoland Malaysia</figcaption></figure>
<h3>How to get to Legoland Malaysia</h3>
<h4>By car</h4>
<p>This is, hands down, the most convenient and comfortable way to get to Legoland Malaysia if you&#8217;re travelling with young kids. Factor in around an hour to drive to the checkpoint and clear immigration (non-peak), then Legoland Malaysia is just 10 minutes away. Do get your <a href="https://vep.jpj.gov.my/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Malaysian vehicle entry permit</a> sorted before your trip, and ensure your Touch &#8216;n Go (the Malaysian version of CashCard) has sufficient value for the tolls and parking at Legoland Malaysia (RM10 per entry).</p>
<h4>By direct coach</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wtstravel.com.sg/coach-tickets/#legoland" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WTS</a> and <a href="https://euholidaysshop.rezdy.com/648766/legoland-malaysia-1-day-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EU Holidays</a> offer direct coach services to Legoland Malaysia from as low as $26. Both companies have pickup points at Suntec City; whereas WTS has an additional pickup point at Jurong East, and EU Holidays at Hotel Boss at Jalan Sultan.</p>
<h4>By public transport (Shuttle Tebrau and Grab)</h4>
<p>My extended family prefers this method, and you&#8217;ll be surprised by how convenient this is. The Shuttle Tebrau is a cross-border train service that travels between Woodlands Train Checkpoint and JB Sentral, and the journey is only five minutes. The plus side? The ticket costs only $5 from Woodlands to JB; then RM5 from JB to Woodlands. The off side? Immigration gate closes 20 minutes before departure, so you&#8217;ll need to get there extra early to beat the queue.</p>
<p>You can easily book a Grab from JB Sentral to Legoland Malaysia, which is about 20-30 minutes away.</p>
<h3>Where to stay in or around Legoland Malaysia</h3>
<figure id="attachment_203159" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-203159" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-203159" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/legoland-hotel-malaysia-building-pirate-theme-guest-room-900x643.jpg" alt="legoland-hotel-malaysia-building-pirate-theme-guest-room" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/legoland-hotel-malaysia-building-pirate-theme-guest-room-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/legoland-hotel-malaysia-building-pirate-theme-guest-room-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/legoland-hotel-malaysia-building-pirate-theme-guest-room.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-203159" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Legoland, Rohini Gomez</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some may want to make Legoland Malaysia a day trip, but I personally prefer to spend a night there so we don&#8217;t need to rush the little ones. There are many accommodation options around Legoland Malaysia. You can make it a full LEGO experience by staying in <a href="https://www.legoland.com.my/hotel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legoland Hotel</a>, where every room has a theme and can comfortably fit a family of five with a king bed and bunk bed. Sneak a peek of the hotel through our <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/legoland-hotel-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest review</a> of it.</p>
<p>There are also many Airbnb listings nearby, particularly in Medini and Sunway City Iskandar Puteri areas. Some of these can accommodate up to 10 pax, which is great if you&#8217;re visiting Legoland Malaysia with a large group of family and friends.</p>
<p><strong>Have the most awesome trip!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://honeykidsasia.com/gess-ib-programme-upgrade/">This international school is investing in over 30 new International Baccalaureate initiatives and programmes – here’s what you need to know</a></p>
<p>We stan a school that values its community, especially one that takes action based on input from families and students. This was exactly what <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/gess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GESS – International School</a> did when it started working on its five-year <a href="https://limitless.gess.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Limitless Learning plan</a> to improve the school’s offerings.</p>
<p>The latest on GESS&#8217; agenda? A revamp of its International Baccalaureate (IB) section’s programme, especially for students following (or planning to follow) this curriculum. Changes kick off in August 2025 – just in time for the 2025/26 academic year. And trust us, it’s going to be good.</p>
<h3>What will GESS’ IB programme restructure cover?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224373" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224373" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224373" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gessib-900x643.jpg" alt="gess ib revamp" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gessib-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gessib-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gessib.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224373" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: GESS – International School</figcaption></figure>
<p>The upgrades will focus on three main areas: high quality teaching and learning, student wellbeing, as well as giving learners more opportunities to pursue their passion.</p>
<p>GESS has a strong focus on personal excellence. With the help of <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/data-driven-school-gess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a>, the school is set to improve its academic offerings to nurture every student’s unique talents, ensuring that everyone can achieve their full potential.</p>
<p>Student wellbeing is also highly prioritised at GESS, and the school will continue to do so for the upcoming academic year. This will be done through more focus on social-emotional learning (SEL); and the school will continue to provide a safe, supported, and structured learning environment for all.</p>
<p>Finally, as a school that champions out-of-classroom learning, GESS continues to emphasise on holistic growth by giving students more opportunities to pursue their passions. There will be more specialist programmes and opportunities for students in leadership, innovation, sustainability, technology, arts, sports, and languages. Its innovative <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/gess-beyondclassrooms-programme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BeyondClassrooms programme</a> will also be boosted.</p>
<h3>What does it mean for students?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224374" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224374" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224374" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gess-primary-900x643.jpg" alt="gess primary" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gess-primary-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gess-primary-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gess-primary.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224374" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: GESS – International School</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you’re wondering how these changes will directly affect your child’s school timetable and learning, we’ve got it all broken down into bite-sized pieces here.</p>
<p>For children in <strong>primary school </strong>(six to 10 years old), you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>French, Spanish, and Mandarin to be newly available in Grade 1 at acquisition level, an optimal time for young students to grasp a foreign language.</li>
<li>A revamped outdoor education programme, including three hours of sports each week.</li>
<li>A new drama programme, in addition to art and music lessons.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_224375" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224375" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224375" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gess-middle-900x643.jpg" alt="gess middle school" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gess-middle-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gess-middle-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gess-middle.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224375" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: GESS – International School</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Middle school</strong> students aged 11-13 years old will see:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new &#8216;Encore&#8217; electives programme that provides students with more opportunities to pursue their passion. This includes over 25 specialist courses in languages, arts, technology, sports, and more within the school&#8217;s timetable.</li>
<li>Better support for students with a new &#8216;Flex&#8217; programme, which includes dedicated time within the timetable for personalised subject support, learning extension, clubs, and leadership.</li>
<li>Smaller advisory homeroom classes of 12-14 students that will result in more individualised student wellbeing and guidance.</li>
<li>More unstructured time built into timetables to reduce stress and foster creativity.</li>
<li>An increase in restorative practices and SEL during advisory homeroom time.</li>
<li>Enhanced mentoring and coaching programme.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_224376" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224376" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224376" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gess-high-900x643.jpg" alt="gess high" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gess-high-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gess-high-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gess-high.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224376" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: GESS – International School</figcaption></figure>
<p>Last but not least, the 14-18 year-old <strong>high school </strong>students can look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li>More pathways to personal success with additional subjects, including environmental systems and societies, as well as computer science.</li>
<li>A Business and Sustainability Pathway, which leads to the internationally recognised IB Careers Programme qualification.</li>
<li>33% more hours of subject teaching, along with enhanced mentorship, one-to-one tutoring, and counselling programmes.</li>
<li>The award-winning BeyondClassrooms programme welcoming a new internship segment and industry expert speaker series.</li>
<li>Career and university guidance units as well as work experience preparation that will be further ramped up to set students up for success beyond school.</li>
</ul>
<h3>More enhancements are on the way!</h3>

Not only do swimming pools guarantee a whole day of splashing good fun, but the swimming complexes in Singapore are totally affordable, too. These amazing <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/kids-swimming-schools-lessons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swimming</a> complexes in the heartlands have a nominal entry fee between $0.50 and $1.70.

<p>A favourite among families, Sengkang Swimming Complex is one of Singapore’s most popular. For starters it&#8217;s massive, plus there are heaps of fun options for kids of all ages. For the bigger children (1.2m and over), there&#8217;s a variety of giant, colourful slides. Think multi-slides, winding tubes and free falls at the very end. Tots don’t have to miss out on all the action either! The splash-and-slide area includes a giant bucket of water that will soak your kids from head to toe (and bring about a serious case of the giggles). For the parents, relax in the jacuzzi pool and let your stresses ebb away with soothing bubbles and powerful jets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://honeykidsasia.com/tanglin-testimonial-lydia-elder/">Tanglin Trust School review: She studied here, and now her kids do too!</a></p>
<p>When Lydia Elder graduated from <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/tanglin-trust-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tanglin Trust School</a> in 2007, little did she know that that wouldn’t be the end of her Tanglin journey. The mum-of-two (and soon to be three!) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lydias_layton_life/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular family content creator</a> didn’t think twice about enrolling her sons at her alma mater when they relocated to Singapore.</p>
<p>“It was always Tanglin!” Lydia said in an <a href="https://alumni.tts.edu.sg/news/alumni-stories/5/5-Lydia-2007-cohort-Made-Best-Friends-for-Life-at-Tanglin-and-Wants-the-Same-for-her-sons-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with the school</a>. “I spent my entire childhood growing up at the school, and I’m just so happy that my kids will be able to have the same amazing schooling and cultural experiences that I did.”</p>
<p>Keep reading as Lydia shares her Tanglin experience with us from her unique position as an alumna who is now a parent of students in the school.</p>
<h3>Hey Lydia, what was it about your experience as a Tanglin student that led you to choose the same school for your sons?</h3>
<p>I had an amazingly positive experience at Tanglin, where I attended from Reception till Year 13. There are so many beautiful memories, from being House Captain for Cameron to school trips and summer fetes in school – all these made me really want my own children to have the same wonderful experience I had.</p>
<p>As a parent, my husband and I really want a school that follows the British curriculum with a high standard of teaching. We also want a school that has good facilities. From my personal experience as an alumna, Tanglin ticks all these boxes. Plus, my mum has been working at Tanglin for 15 years. So, to have the boys go to the same school where their grandma works is another added bonus.</p>
<figure id="attachment_224532" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224532" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224532" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Honeykids-Asia-900x643.jpg" alt="tanglin gymnastic" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Honeykids-Asia-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Honeykids-Asia-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Honeykids-Asia.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224532" class="wp-caption-text">Tanglin Gymnastics Centre.<br />Photography: Tanglin Trust School</figcaption></figure>
<h3>And now you’re a Tanglin parent! How has it been so far?</h3>
<p>Tanglin exceeded our expectations and my boys are thriving there! They joined the school about four years ago, currently attending Years 3 and 5. I have a little boy on the way and I&#8217;m already planning on enrolling him in <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/why-tanglin-infant-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tanglin Infant School</a> in a few years time.</p>
<p>I remember Tanglin as a school with a strong community spirit, and was happy to see that this is still the case when my sons joined the school. The community, especially the mum who was the class representative for my youngest son, welcomed us to Singapore even before school started. She and her son did a video call with us to help my kids feel more at ease when they attended Tanglin for the first time. It was such a lovely gesture, and our boys are best friends till this day!</p>
<p>Academic-wise, Tanglin has provided us with tremendous support, especially for my oldest son. He had some difficulty with phonics and reading as he missed a lot of his early years education due to the lockdowns. But Tanglin has supported him amazingly – now he no longer needs learning support and is an avid reader. Thanks to Tanglin, both my boys have grown so much in their confidence and look forward to school every day.</p>
<h3>What do they like about Tanglin?</h3>
<p>They love that their teachers trust them with responsibilities, which they get to carry out in a safe space. The boys are also heavily involved in Tanglin’s gymnastics co-curricular activity (CCA), and they enjoy training in the <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/tanglin-centenary-building/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centenary Building</a>’s state-of-the-art gymnastics centre. They’re also part of the school’s Merlions swim team and love training in the building’s new aquatics centre.</p>
<figure id="attachment_224533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224533" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224533" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/swim-900x643.jpg" alt="tanglin teddy swim gala" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/swim-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/swim-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/swim.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224533" class="wp-caption-text">Teddy getting ready to swim at a recent Junior Gala in the Tanglin Aquatics Centre.<br />Photography: Tanglin Trust School</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Tell us more about the Tanglin community.</h3>
<p>The school has a community group called Friends of Tanglin that organises events for Tanglin families throughout the year. This can be in the form of cultural celebrations, quiz and movie nights, and other parent-child activities.</p>
<p>Tanglin highly encourages parents to be involved in various aspects of their kids’ school life, so we’re always welcomed on campus. From learning mornings to the school’s Parentwise talks, as well as sports events and storytelling sessions by parents – there are so many ways that we’re allowed to volunteer and contribute. There’s even a parent co-working space in the Centenary Building – I’ve used the communal desks before, and there are private offices we can book too.</p>
<h3>Last but not least, what do you value most about Tanglin?</h3>
<p>We appreciate that Tanglin encourages children to pursue their interests in all areas, not limited to just academics. It’s also a school that gives children the confidence, drive, and resources to be what they want to be.</p>
<p>I also want to highlight the open channels of communication Tanglin has between teachers and parents. We’ve always received timely responses whenever we email the boys’ teachers. This extends to the CCA coordinators and admin staff as well. For example, whenever there’s a big event coming up, such as exams and overnight school trips, Tanglin will always host an in-person parent presentation with Q&amp;A sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for sharing with us, Lydia!</strong></p>

<h2>Where to eat with kids on Orchard Road</h2>
<h3>1. Little Farms Table at Tanglin Mall</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224584" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224584" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Little-Farms-Table.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224584" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Little-Farms-Table-900x643.png" alt="Little Farms Table" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Little-Farms-Table-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Little-Farms-Table-768x549.png 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Little-Farms-Table.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224584" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Little Farms Table</figcaption></figure>
<p>We love <a href="https://littlefarmscafe.com/pages/little-farms-table-tanglin" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Little Farms Table</a> for their wholesome dishes made with fresh produce and we love them even more for catering to everyone in the fam. Besides a dedicated kids menu with food that&#8217;s fun to eat, think <strong>Berry Fun Panca</strong>ke ($12++) and <strong>Cheesy Breakfast Quesa-Pocket</strong> ($13++), the placemat even comes with quick puzzles to keep the little ones busy. And of course, for adults, there&#8217;s the <strong>Avocado Smash on Sourdough</strong> ($23++) for breakfast and the <strong>Chicken and Cauliflower Rice</strong> ($27++) for lunch. Plus, they open really early too!</p>
<p><em><strong>Where</strong>: 163 Tanglin Road #02-136 Tanglin Mall Singapore (247933)</em><br />
<em><strong>Opening hours</strong>: Mon &#8211; Fri 7.30am &#8211; 3.30pm, 5pm &#8211; 9.30pm, Sat &#8211; Sun 7.30am &#8211; 9,30pm</em></p>
<h3>2. Gyu San at Forum the Shopping Mall</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224544" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224544" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224544" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gyu-San-dining-in-Orchard-Road-900x643.jpg" alt="Gyu San dining in Orchard Road" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gyu-San-dining-in-Orchard-Road-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gyu-San-dining-in-Orchard-Road-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gyu-San-dining-in-Orchard-Road.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224544" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Gyu San via Facebook</figcaption></figure>
<p>This Japanese restaurant is also a supplier of top-quality Wagyu in Singapore, which is why you&#8217;ll find them in their sandos, burgers, and grilled selections. <a href="https://gyusan.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gyu San</a> does have a kids menu, but my son loves this place for its tableside charcoal grill. Order the <strong>Hamburg Set Meal</strong> ($25.80), which comes with two Wagyu patties, rice, salad, and miso soup, and you&#8217;ll get to grill the patties to your liking. Cooking with charcoal is a little more unpredictable than cooking on an electric grill (that&#8217;s where the fun is!), plus it imparts a light smokiness which makes the meal all the more delectable! There&#8217;s a hidden counter seating for its izakaya experience, think grilled meats, small bites, and of course, sake.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where</strong>: 583 Orchard Rd, #01-28 Forum The Shopping Mall, Singapore 238884<br />
<em><strong>Opening hours</strong>: Mon &#8211; Thu 11.30am &#8211; 10pm, Fri 11.30am &#8211; 12am, Sat 10.30am &#8211; 12am, Sun 10.30am &#8211; 10pm</em></em></p>
<h3>3. Merci Marcel at Palais Renaissance</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224545" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224545" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224545" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Merci-Marcel-Orchard-dining--900x643.jpg" alt="Merci Marcel Orchard dining" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Merci-Marcel-Orchard-dining--900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Merci-Marcel-Orchard-dining--768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Merci-Marcel-Orchard-dining-.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224545" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Merci Marcel Orchard</figcaption></figure>
<p>Orchard Road is almost always bustling, so when you find a spot that takes you away from it all, you know you&#8217;ve struck gold! The bright and airy space of <a href="https://mercimarcelgroup.com/merci-marcel/orchard-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Merci Marcel</a> makes it the perfect spot to fuel up for a day out with the fam.  They open early enough for breakfast so you can dig into organic eggs – <strong>Scrambled</strong> ($21++) or <strong>Poached</strong> ($25++) – alongside hot bakes from the French bakery. They have an extensive lunch and dinner menu, as well as an Afternoon Break menu with French cheeses and cold cuts. Feel like you&#8217;re in France yet?</p>
<p><em><strong>Where</strong>: 390 Orchard Road, Palais Renaissance, #01 &#8211; 03 / 04, Singapore 238871</em><br />
<em><strong>Opening hours</strong>: Tues &#8211; Sat 8am &#8211; 12am, Sun &#8211; Mon 8am &#8211; 11pm</em></p>
<h3>4. Pano Kato Grill, Pizza &amp; Deli at Tanglin Mall</h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-192066 aligncenter" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Resizing-21-900x643.jpg" alt="orchard family-friendly dining pano kato" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Resizing-21-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Resizing-21-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Resizing-21.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>When it comes to Greek Mediterranean cuisine, Pano Kato’s one of our go-to restos. And it’s not just for its food or the bright tropical decor (a selection from House of AnLi just right upstairs!), but for its ultra kid-friendly service too! For starters, we love the extensive kid’s menu, which includes freshly baked wood oven pizzas, pasta, and souvlaki. The restaurant also offers children a complimentary <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-toy-stores-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playing set</a>. That way, the kiddos can keep themselves <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/where-to-buy-jigsaw-puzzles-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">occupied with the puzzle</a> placemat, or start colouring with their new colouring pencils. Of course, you can bring these home too (major yasss!). But the best of all? Kids’ meals will always be served first at Pano Kato. No hangry kid = a happy, enjoyable family meal. Score!</p>
<p><em><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://houseofanli.com/pages/pano-kato" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pano Kato</a>, 163 Tanglin Rd, #02-142/144 Tanglin Mall, Singapore 247933<br />

<p>Sometimes the gift of good rest is all we need, especially for us mums. And the road to good rest couldn’t start better than with a pair of comfy PJs or loungewear! Lucky for us, Singapore is far from short of local brands offering luxurious loungewear. We&#8217;ve waxed lyrical about <a href="https://rawbought.com/shop-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rawbought</a>&#8216;s buttery-soft PJ sets, but we also love the ones from mumpreneur-owned <a href="https://www.raphandremy.com/collections/womens" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RAPH &amp; REMY</a> and local brand <a href="https://sojao.shop/collections/loungewear" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SOJAO</a>.</p>

<p>Some of us mums dream of nothing more than a short sabbatical without having to worry about the littlies in tow. Need we mention the long list of responsibilities that follow? Even if it&#8217;s just for a few hours! Here’s a nudge towards dads and kiddos, a day <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/family-friendly-hotel-staycation-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staycation</a> (or overnighter) is a great gift to give hard-working mummies a break for Mother’s Day. All mums need is a few hours to themselves and a change of scene for a relaxing celebration.</p>
<h3>14. Treat Mum to afternoon tea</h3>
<figure id="attachment_223783" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223783" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-223783 size-medium" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/atlas-afternoon-tea-900x643.jpg" alt="Mother's day things to do: atlas afternoon tea" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/atlas-afternoon-tea-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/atlas-afternoon-tea-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/atlas-afternoon-tea.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-223783" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Afternoon tea at Atlas, Andrina Loo</figcaption></figure>
<p>We&#8217;d love to be spoilt with gourmet delights at one of these <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/mothers-day-dining-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">splendid afternoon teas</a>. From tea for two to kid-friendly options, there&#8217;s something for every mum on this list! Even better if you can combine a special day out with an equally special gift.</p>
<h3>15. Indulge at a Mother&#8217;s Day brunch</h3>
<figure id="attachment_172882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172882" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-172882" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Marriott-Cafe-Celebration-of-Love-1-900x643.jpg" alt="where_to_eat_mothers_day_2021_singapore_marriott_tang" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Marriott-Cafe-Celebration-of-Love-1-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Marriott-Cafe-Celebration-of-Love-1-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Marriott-Cafe-Celebration-of-Love-1.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-172882" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Marriott Cafe</figcaption></figure>
<p>If an afternoon tea doesn&#8217;t float your boat, then opt to go all out with one of these <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/mothers-day-dining-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fab Mother&#8217;s Day brunches</a> in Singapore, or a set menu option. The restaurants are pulling out all the stops so get booking early; we reckon these could be in demand!</p>
<h3>16. Capture mum&#8217;s beautiful side</h3>
<figure id="attachment_223980" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223980" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-223980" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/White-room-studio-1-900x643.jpg" alt="White Room studio mothers day gift ideas" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/White-room-studio-1-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/White-room-studio-1-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/White-room-studio-1.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-223980" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: White Room Studio</figcaption></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://honeykidsasia.com/little-sifa-2025/">SIFA 2025: We find out what’s in store (and FREE) for kiddos at Singapore’s most exciting performing arts festival</a></p>
<p>Believe it or not, the biggest performing arts fans in the HoneyKids team aren’t the writers; it’s our kids. Which is why we’re excited to hear that <a href="https://sifa.sg/sifa-2025/little-sifa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little SIFA</a>, the family-friendly programme pillar of <a href="https://sifa.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Singapore International Festival of Arts (SIFA)</a>, is returning for a second edition this year.</p>
<p>What’s more, we’re told that Little SIFA is expanding its scope to cover more art forms beyond <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/family-friendly-programmes-sifa-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a>’s theatre and interactive installation. And better still – this year’s Little SIFA programmes are all FOC!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What&#8217;s happening at Little SIFA 2025</h2>
<h3>1. The House Between the Winds by Yang Jie</h3>
<p>The little ones will be thrilled to see a magnificent sailboat travel across the festival ground. But that’s not all, kids are invited to be part of the sailboat’s ‘journey’ as it travels through Singapore’s history. Through this moving art installation, you and the kids get to experience how Singapore evolved from a trading post into a safe harbour and home for many of us.</p>
<p><em><strong>When:</strong> Installation open for visiting daily from 19 May &#8211; 1 June, 10am -9pm; performance on 23-25 May and 30 May &#8211; 1 June 2025, 5-9pm</em></p>
<h3>2. The Purple Symphony</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224408" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224408" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224408" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-purple-900x643.jpg" alt="sifa purple symphony" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-purple-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-purple-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-purple.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224408" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Singapore International Festival of Arts</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let the kids dance or sing along to The Purple Symphony’s rendition of familiar tunes at SIFA. Unlike most orchestras, this is one that’s comprised of talented musicians of all abilities, using a mixture of Asian and Western instruments to put on a twist on all-time favourite scores.</p>
<p><em><strong>When:</strong> 23-25 May 2025, 7-7.30pm</em></p>
<h3>3. Animal Farm (30-minute variation) by The Finger Players</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224409" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224409" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-animal-farm-900x643.jpg" alt="sifa animal farm" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-animal-farm-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-animal-farm-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-animal-farm.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224409" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: The Finger Players</figcaption></figure>
<p>Animal Farm may be quite heavy for the kids, but Little SIFA has a shorter variation of the full puppet show adaptation of the George Orwell classic. Think of this as a kid-friendly introduction to the story, with the chance for the littles to get up close and personal with the life-sized puppets of each character, which we heard were specially commissioned by The Fingers Player puppetry theatre company.</p>
<p><em><strong>When:</strong> 30 May &#8211; 1 June 2025, 7-7.30pm</em></p>
<p>All of Little SIFA’s programmes will be held at Empress Lawn, near the Victoria Concert Hall and Asian Civilisations Museum.</p>
<h3>Wait, there’s more to SIFA than Little SIFA…</h3>
<p>We read that the first ever SIFA Pavilion is a great spot for you to visit with the kiddos too. Stationed in Bedok Town Square, the location will be transformed into an arts space for the duration of the festival to feature visual pieces and performances. Here are some of our top picks.</p>
<h3>4. Speculative F(r)ictions by Brian Gothong Tan</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224410" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224410" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-pavilion-900x643.jpg" alt="sifa speculative friction" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-pavilion-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-pavilion-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-pavilion.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224410" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Singapore International Festival of Arts</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ever wonder about Bedok’s history? This multimedia experience uses CGI effects and glitch art to tell a reimagined story of the town’s maritime past. Really cool, especially for older kids!</p>
<p><em><strong>When:</strong> Every Friday to Sunday from 16 May &#8211; 1 June 2025</em></p>
<h3>5. A Future Untold</h3>
<p>Kids love art; and they love it more when they can participate in it. A Future Untold is an art workshop that’s opened to the public, using marine debris to create unique ‘paintings’. We like that it encourages kids’ imaginations to run wild, while teaching them the importance of sustainability at the same time.</p>
<p><em><strong>When:</strong> 23-25 May 2025, 4-9pm</em></p>
<h3>6. Sing Song Social Club</h3>
<figure id="attachment_224411" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224411" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224411" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-sing-song-900x643.jpg" alt="sifa sing song social club" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-sing-song-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-sing-song-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sifa-sing-song.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224411" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Singapore International Festival of Arts</figcaption></figure>
<p>A choir performance that allows its audience to join in? Count us (and the kids) in! Nothing makes the little ones happier than being able to sing their favourite tunes along with a big group. Sing Song Social Club provides everyone – young and young and heart – a safe space for their voices to be heard, we stan!</p>
<p><em><strong>When:</strong> 1 June 2025, 8.15pm</em></p>
<p>From whimsical art installations to sing-along performances, there’s something for every family at SIFA 2025. So mark your calendars for these highlights, or check out the <a href="https://sifa.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIFA official website</a> for other programmes and the full schedule.</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, bullying doesn’t just happen behind closed doors, it can even play out online in viral videos and messages, deepening its impact and effects on everyone involved. In the 6th episode of Parenting Playbook, we speak with Dr. Kimberly Chew of AO Psychology (Singapore) to understand the psychological impact of bullying on children – the bullied and the bully. We delve into the nature of today’s bullying, how parents can recognise the early signs of bullying. We cover practical advice on  how to support your child with compassion and guide them towards emotional resilience and safety.</p>
<p>Dr. Kimberly Chew is an SRP Registered Psychologist with the Singapore Register of Psychologists (SRP) and a mother of three, with a unique perspective on parenting and childhood trauma. She graduated with First Class honours in Doctorate in Clinical Psychology, and founded <a href="https://aopsychology.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AO Psychology (Singapore)</a>, a holistic psychology practice that uniquely integrates mind (psychotherapy and counselling), body (somatic) and emotion (nutrition) interventions. With her vast experience in both private practice and institutional settings, Dr. Chew emphasises collaboration and empowerment, helping clients develop coping strategies and achieve sustainable mental health outcomes.</p>

<p>“Mum, can I have my own phone? All my friends have one.” Ah, the dreaded day is here! We totally understand the FOMO that may arise from tweens and teens seeing their friends own their own smartphones. But all the advice we’ve heard thus far has been: hold off on giving your kids a phone for as long as possible! So how do we navigate this? HoneyKids host Angela Neo chats with Lauren Adlam on navigating this new minefield! Lauren is a mum of four and founder of <a href="https://www.zown.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ZOWN</a>, a kids-only app that&#8217;s all about positivity and created to nurture Gen Alpha (between eight and 14 years old) to thrive.</p>

<p>If the viral Netflix show <em>Adolescence</em> left you with more questions than answers, you’re not alone. From the rise of the Manosphere to the coded language teens use online, today’s digital world is complex—and constantly shifting. So fast that parents are not even aware. In this episode of Parenting Playbook, we speak with Shem Yao, Head of TOUCH Cyber Wellness to unpack today’s digital realities and online subcultures that are shaping our children’s beliefs and behaviours – for better or for worse. He shares how parents of teens can connect meaningfully with their children, spot red flags, guide them to online safety, and think critically in an ever-connected world.</p>
<p>Shem Yao leads <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touchcyberwellness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TOUCH Cyber Wellness</a> under the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touchcommunityservices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TOUCH Community Services</a>, delivering digital and media literacy programmes to schools, communities, and corporations.

<p>A great way to escape the heat (or <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/things-to-do-at-home-with-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rain</a>) is to head to a <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-kid-friendly-museums-exhibitions-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">museum</a> or art gallery. The good news is there are several free options, and others have heavily discounted or free children&#8217;s entry, making them an affordable day out. A firm fave on our list is <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.sg/gallerykids/keppelcentre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Keppel Centre for Art Education</a> which has loads of interactive displays and is housed in the beautiful National Gallery Singapore.</p>

<h3>3. Hang out at the library!</h3>
<figure id="attachment_196293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-196293" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-196293" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HKA-image-resize-1400-x-1000-1400-%C3%97-1000px-34.png" alt="library@harbourfront" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HKA-image-resize-1400-x-1000-1400-%C3%97-1000px-34.png 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HKA-image-resize-1400-x-1000-1400-%C3%97-1000px-34-900x643.png 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HKA-image-resize-1400-x-1000-1400-%C3%97-1000px-34-768x549.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-196293" class="wp-caption-text">Library@harbourfront! Image: National Library Board</figcaption></figure>
<p>Singapore has a host of fab, kid-friendly <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/the-best-libraries-for-kids-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">libraries</a> to take little bookworms to, and they are free to visit! One of our faves is the library@harbourfront, with over 200,000 books, magazines, and audio-visual materials in a 3000 sqm space! library@harbourfront is the largest shopping mall library in Singapore, and the best part? It’s got an awesome Children’s Zone where kids can check out digital books and activities in the Tumblebook stations. Alternatively, they can immerse themselves in the Stories Come Alive Room. Plus, there’s also a Tinker Truck children’s maker space where kids can get their hands on DIY crafts and puzzles.</p>
<h3>4. Explore a mall (with indoor playgrounds!)</h3>
<p><a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/shopping-malls-with-amazing-play-areas-for-kids-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malls</a> are not just about the shops; oh no, there are plenty of fun and free things to do in Singapore to keep the kids entertained. Many are home to some pretty cool playgrounds (we love Paragon in Orchard for this!), and then there are the super-cool displays for big events such as Chinese New Year and Christmas. Malls such as VivoCity also have plenty of outdoor space (head up to level 3) where the kids can burn off energy, and you can take in those views over to Sentosa!</p>
<h3>5. Visit a temple</h3>
<figure id="attachment_175944" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175944" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-175944" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/buddhist-temple-singapore-kong-meng-san-phor-kark-see-monastery.jpg" alt="Buddhist temple in Singapore | Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/buddhist-temple-singapore-kong-meng-san-phor-kark-see-monastery.jpg 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/buddhist-temple-singapore-kong-meng-san-phor-kark-see-monastery-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/buddhist-temple-singapore-kong-meng-san-phor-kark-see-monastery-768x549.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-175944" class="wp-caption-text">This Buddhist temple at Bright Hill Road is the largest in Singapore.

<p>Another great indoor option for free things to do with kids in Singapore is to visit a temple! There are so many <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-temples-in-singapore-to-visit-with-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beautiful temples to explore</a>. We especially love The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, a four-storey Buddhist temple and museum complex found in the heart of the Chinatown district. The temple is based on the Tang dynasty architectural style and built to house the tooth relic of Buddha. This place is ornate, opulent and full of fascinating tales and history. Make sure you catch one of the free guided tours for this must-see temple and museum.</p>
<h3>6. Whisk yourself off to Jewel Changi Airport</h3>
<figure id="attachment_206061" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-206061" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-206061" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/jewel-changi-hsbc-vortex-waterfall-singapore.jpg" alt="jewel-changi-hsbc-vortex-waterfall-singapore" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/jewel-changi-hsbc-vortex-waterfall-singapore.jpg 1400w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/jewel-changi-hsbc-vortex-waterfall-singapore-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/jewel-changi-hsbc-vortex-waterfall-singapore-768x549.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-206061" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Changi Airport via Facebook</figcaption></figure>

We love Marina Barrage, <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/what-to-do-in-punggol-with-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Punggol Waterway Park</a>, Sembawang Park and Jurong Central Park. Best of all, it&#8217;s completely free! So dust off your kites, and don&#8217;t forget to slap on some sunblock before taking off!</p>

<h3>33. NEW: Take a stroll around the new Keppel Coastal Trail at Labrador Nature Park</h3>
<figure id="attachment_221852" class="wp-caption alignnone" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-221852"><img class="size-medium wp-image-221852 lazyloaded" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/labrador-nature-reserve-keppel-coastal-trail-900x643.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/labrador-nature-reserve-keppel-coastal-trail-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/labrador-nature-reserve-keppel-coastal-trail-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/labrador-nature-reserve-keppel-coastal-trail.jpg 1400w" alt="labrador nature reserve keppel coastal trail" width="900" height="643" data-srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/labrador-nature-reserve-keppel-coastal-trail-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/labrador-nature-reserve-keppel-coastal-trail-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/labrador-nature-reserve-keppel-coastal-trail.jpg 1400w" data-src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/labrador-nature-reserve-keppel-coastal-trail-900x643.jpg" data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-221852" class="wp-caption-text">Photos: NParks</figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of coastal trails and getting back to nature, we are happy to report a new find! This is one for the west-siders. The new Keppel Coastal Trail is a 340-metre route that passes through the coastal beach forest habitat within Labrador Nature Park. Great for wheelchair users and those with strollers, the new coastal trail offers unblocked views of the sea and the opportunity for people to get closer to biodiversity. While you’re there, book a barbecue pit or set up your picnic supplies in the shade along the scenic promenade. Be warned: the mosquitoes ate us alive, so pack insect repellent!</p>
<p>Teeming with wildlife, the park has nature trails for a leisurely stroll, plus the genuine World War II relics (including a fort and secret tunnels). There’s a small playground (it’s in full sun, so be sure to stay sun smart). Older kids might tolerate the decent walk along the promenade to family-friendly restaurant Privé on Keppel Island.<br />

And we are big fans of encouraging tiny hands in the kitchen when it comes to helping prepare our <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-asian-local-dishes-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">favourite local foods</a> and international dishes. So, if you have a little wannabe master chef busting to get their hands on your pots and pans, then the time may have come for you to sign your kiddo up for a cooking lesson! But before you let the small people loose with your snazzy kitchen gadgets to begin baking <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-cupcakes-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customised cupcakes</a> or <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/best-bakeries-in-singapore-buy-fresh-bread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delicious breads</a>, check out these fun cooking classes for kids in Singapore.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">The best cooking classes for kids in Singapore</h2>

<figure id="attachment_219775" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-219775" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-219775" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Anatta-Culinary-Academy-900x643.jpg" alt="kids cooking classes Anatta Culinary Academy" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Anatta-Culinary-Academy-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Anatta-Culinary-Academy-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Anatta-Culinary-Academy.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-219775" class="wp-caption-text">Photography: Anatta Culinary Academy</figcaption></figure>
<p>Remember all those fun pizza nights and baking parties? If your little one’s always up for getting their hands dirty in the kitchen, a regular cooking sesh might be what they’ll look forward to all week. <a href="https://www.anattaca.sg/book-a-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Anatta Culinary Academy</a> has got just the thing, with a roll call for all tiny master chefs to join its new weekly culinary after-school enrichment programme! Specially curated for kiddos aged seven to 10, the small-group Junior Chef’s Journey course covers cooking and baking basics, kitchen safety, and development of essential life skills. There’s a global spin to it too with students getting to learn ten recipes from all around the world. Watch them roll up their sleeves, and get to work on basil fried rice, gnocchi, and meatball shakshuka. The best part? The programme is designed to complement the school’s curriculum, with educational bits seamlessly interwoven in. For example, they’ll be given simple mathematics questions, such as how to calculate how many grams of butter are needed for a particular recipe. That’s not all: adults get to hone their skills with leisure and foundational culinary lessons too! If you’re cracking your heads over where to have your company’s next corporate team-building, Anatta Culinary Academy also has special programmes, offers chef hires for demonstrations, and even rents out its kitchen studio for private events and gatherings.</p>

<h3>You’re known for having some pretty unorthodox labour stories — can you share one that stands out?</h3>
<p>Honestly, I feel incredibly blessed with each of my birth experiences. They&#8217;ve all been so unique and memorable. My most recent, the birth of my third child at home, was particularly extraordinary. I know a home birth might sound unconventional, even a little daunting to some, but for me, it was a moment of peaceful chaos. I felt deeply connected with my daughter and to bring her into the world in the comfort of our home, with my husband by my side, while our eldest child slept peacefully nearby.</p>
<p>I was managing the surges and contractions so well at home that I didn&#8217;t feel any need to rush to the <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/24-hour-family-clinic-gp-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospital</a>. In fact, it was when we finally decided to head to the hospital that my contractions intensified significantly—almost as if my baby had her own, very specific plan for her arrival. Ultimately, a powerful surge came, and I gave birth standing up.</p>
<p>My baby simply slid out, and my husband had to make a rather dramatic, but successful, &#8216;football dive&#8217; to catch her! After she was born, we shared the news with our family. Our parents were understandably quite surprised, but our grandmothers just matter-of-factly acknowledged, because that’s how they gave birth back then too, so I felt really good about it. It was a truly empowering and unforgettable experience.</p>
<figure id="attachment_224147" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224147" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224147" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ho-kin-ing-kindle-space-founder-breathing-900x643.jpg" alt="ho kin ing kindle space founder breathing" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ho-kin-ing-kindle-space-founder-breathing-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ho-kin-ing-kindle-space-founder-breathing-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ho-kin-ing-kindle-space-founder-breathing.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224147" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Kindle Space</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Did you use any yoga or pilates techniques during labour? If so, how did they help?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. For me, yoga wasn&#8217;t just about flexibility or for “opening your hips” though that&#8217;s a common misconception. What truly made a difference were the breathing techniques, the mind-body connection, and the heightened awareness it cultivated. When labour surges and contractions came, I found myself relying heavily on my breath to navigate through them. Of course, the physical aspects of yoga such as the strengthening and stretching, played a vital role too. It really helped me attune to both my baby and my own body during the process.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve come to think of yoga as a sort of toolbox, filled with invaluable resources. I feel incredibly privileged to have had the opportunity to learn these practices. Ultimately, it was embodying the principles of yoga and maintaining an open mind that truly helped me through labour and those early postpartum years.</p>
<h3>What inspired you to start Kindle Space, and how is it different from other yoga studios in Singapore?</h3>
<p>I created Kindle Space to fill a gap: a dedicated safe space for women and mothers during the prenatal and postpartum periods. Community, Connection, Movement. We&#8217;re unique in Singapore because we exclusively offer prenatal and postpartum classes for this stage of life, including mama &amp; baby sessions and <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/antenatal-classes-singapore-new-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">childbirth preparation</a>. Our focus is on building community and providing both physical and emotional support.</p>
<p>Kindle Space was born from my own struggle to find dedicated support during pregnancy and postpartum in Singapore. In 2018, navigating my first pregnancy, I realised there was a significant gap: a lack of a single, nurturing space for birth preparation. I wanted a place where I can attend prenatal classes, workshops, highly experienced teachers and a genuine community. I found myself scattered, searching for yoga, classes and workshops across Singapore.</p>
<p>Postpartum also hit me hard. I felt isolated, overwhelmed, and unprepared for the mental and emotional load. I experienced undiagnosed postpartum depression (PPD), and though I did not receive professional treatment, I relied on my yoga and meditation practice to go through the intense moments.</p>
<p>In 2023, during my third pregnancy, I decided to leave my corporate role and follow my gut to create this communal space for mothers, exactly as what I would wish for. A space for mothers to come together during pregnancy, connect with one another, birth together and return again postpartum. Unlike other yoga studios, Kindle Space is exclusively dedicated to prenatal and postpartum. As a studio, we organise community playdates, support groups and even nature walks for mothers and babies.</p>
<figure id="attachment_224148" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224148" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224148" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/kindle-space-class-900x643.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/kindle-space-class-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/kindle-space-class-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/kindle-space-class.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224148" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Kindle Space</figcaption></figure>
<p>What truly sets us apart is our focus on &#8216;Social Maternal Care.&#8217; Over the years, I have recognised that there are many others like me. PPD is a “smiling depression”, especially for over achievers and high performing modern women. We may look functional and well on the outside, but the feelings and mood fluctuations still hit us. Not everyone will seek out counselling or therapy, but everyone can benefit from Community, Connection and Movement. By providing a familiar and supportive environment, we empower mothers to return postpartum, knowing they have a safe haven. We welcome them back as early as six weeks. It is that high-five, hello-how-are-you, so-happy-to-see-you-again connection that makes Kindle Space who we are.</p>
<p>When we think of sisterhood, it’s a group of sisters. Brotherhood, it’s a band of brothers. But when it becomes motherhood, it’s tiring, expensive, lonely or sleepless nights. It’s across all my social media to bring back the remembrance – if we go back long enough, Motherhood is called a &#8216;hood&#8217; for a reason, and that’s how our “Social Maternal Care” philosophy came about.</p>

<h3>What kind of community have you built at your studio, and what role does it play for the mums who come through your doors?</h3>
<p>Kindle Space is really more than just a studio to me. It&#8217;s like a safety net for women, the one I wished I had back then. My team and I have worked relentlessly hard to build a community where everyone understands the incredible journey of pregnancy and postpartum. It&#8217;s a place where shared experiences just instantly create connections, and we solidarity in each other, and we talk about the challenges of motherhood together.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something really special about knowing you&#8217;re not alone – that someone else is up at 3 am, or seeing pregnant women connect with those who&#8217;ve recently had their babies. It&#8217;s like a glimpse into the future or a sweet reminder of the recent past, and it creates these beautiful moments for reflection.</p>
<p>We really focus on empowering mums to connect, not just with each other, but also with their own inner voices. My goal is to lead with what I call &#8216;Social Maternal Care&#8217; – providing a really supportive community that nurtures both physical and emotional well-being. We understand that not everyone seeks out professional help, but everyone, truly everyone, benefits from community and connection. We&#8217;re here to bridge that gap and, when needed, gently guide mums toward professional support.</p>

<h3>What’s one thing you wish more mums knew about the benefits of a group class?</h3>
<p>I really want mums to understand that the group classes we hold are about so much more than just physical exercise. They&#8217;re a powerful catalyst for motivation and genuine connection. Seeing other mothers actively prioritise their wellness journeys is incredibly inspiring, like a 15-week pregnant mama would look at a 38-week mama and go like, “Wow, this is so cool.”</p>
<p>At Kindle Space, we really emphasise the shared experience, creating a supportive environment where mums can connect on a deeper level. The acknowledging and sharing circles we incorporate into our classes are crucial for this; they foster a sense of collective strength and understanding. And that community extends far beyond the studio walls. We organise mom dates and playdates, recognising the importance of building those connections outside of class. In a world where digital interactions are increasingly prevalent, the power of real, human connection remains irreplaceable. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re cultivating: a space where mums can truly connect and support one another.</p>
<h3>What advice would you give to mums who feel guilty about self-care?</h3>
<p>You know, someone once told me, very directly, that even F1 cars need pit stops. And they&#8217;re absolutely right! It really hit home when they added, &#8220;If you can&#8217;t do it for yourself, at least do it for your child.&#8221;</p>
<p>It made me think back to when I was a kid, those evenings when my parents came home stressed. You could just feel it in the air, right? I&#8217;d tiptoe around, trying so hard not to &#8216;get in the way&#8217;. And that&#8217;s exactly the kind of energy our little ones pick up on.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve really been trying to prioritise <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/ideas-for-self-care-for-mums/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-care</a>, even in the smallest ways. Just a warm glass of water, a quick bath, or even five minutes of sunlight can make a huge difference. That tenderness, that gentleness we give ourselves, really goes a long way. Because at the end of the day, self-care isn&#8217;t just for us. It&#8217;s for our children too.</p>
<h3>Do you have a go-to pose or breathing technique that mums can use during stressful moments?</h3>
<p>Yes, I do! Physically, a modified wide-legged Child’s Pose is often very soothing. We can use plenty of bolsters and pillows to make it extra comfortable, especially during pregnancy to accommodate the baby-belly. It’s wonderful for relieving lower back tension, and the gentle pressure on the chest can be incredibly grounding. For those experiencing pubic pain or pubic symphysis, I’d suggest kneeling with knees only slightly wider than hip-width, or simply lying on their side with pillows between the legs, while practicing breath awareness (more on that below).</p>
<p>Beyond the physical, I find tremendous value in breath awareness. You know, there are so many voices and experts telling us ‘how’ to breathe, and while that can be helpful, sometimes it can inadvertently make us second-guess our own bodies. Just simply observing the breath, without trying to change it, can be profoundly calming. Allowing the breath to come and go naturally provides a moment to slow down and appreciate our body’s innate wisdom in pacing our breath with ease. That’s why returning to the simple act of observing the breath, just as it is, is my favourite grounding practice. It’s a gentle reminder that our bodies already possess the ability to find calm from within.</p>
<figure id="attachment_224157" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224157" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-224157" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kin-ing-kindle-space-mum-grandmother-900x643.jpg" alt="kin ing kindle space mum grandmother" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kin-ing-kindle-space-mum-grandmother-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kin-ing-kindle-space-mum-grandmother-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kin-ing-kindle-space-mum-grandmother.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224157" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Ho Kin Ing</figcaption></figure>
<h3>What&#8217;s your idea of spending quality time with your kids while providing quality teaching at your studio?</h3>
<p>The biggest thing was figuring out what &#8216;quality time&#8217; even meant. It took me a while, but I&#8217;ve come to realise it&#8217;s all about being &#8216;consciously present.&#8217; And that&#8217;s more than just putting down my phone or laptop. It&#8217;s about actively directing my attention and intention to whatever I&#8217;m doing in that moment. Whether I&#8217;m reading a bedtime story to my daughters or leading a prenatal yoga class at Kindle Space, I have to be fully &#8216;there&#8217;. Because, honestly, kids and students can tell when you&#8217;re not, right? They pick up on that. It&#8217;s actually kind of like when I commit to my weekly nature walks or community events. It&#8217;s a mental muscle I have to keep training – to be present not just physically, but also mentally, emotionally, and whole-personly.</p>
<h3>If you could describe motherhood in one yoga pose, what would it be and why?</h3>
<p>Oh, that&#8217;s such a cool question! It really got me thinking, and you know what? I keep coming back to Vrksasana aka Tree Pose. So, first off, it&#8217;s a balancing pose, right? <em>Balancing</em> and not “balance” because I don’t think there will ever be total-complete-balance but recognising it’s a constant balancing act. And that’s really what motherhood is? It’s like swaying with the gentle breeze or with strong winds. We&#8217;re always adjusting to the &#8216;winds&#8217; of life – kids, family, our own stuff. Tree pose kind of shows that adaptability.</p>
<p>Then, there&#8217;s also the whole grounding thing. A tree is as strong as its roots, right? And there is so much wisdom in that. I feel like that&#8217;s us as moms. For the roots to be strong, it’s dependent on the soil – support and self-care. If we want to hold others, we got to be able to hold (trust) ourselves first. But, at the same time, we also need to know when to say &#8220;enough,&#8221; you know? We can&#8217;t over-fertilise the soil, by giving too much advice or allowing too much external influence etc.</p>
<p>And then, the branches! It’s such an unspoken intelligence holding onto a falling leaf while new ones are growing… that&#8217;s motherhood, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s about patience and time. Like how we celebrate our babies first but we also have to prepare for their last, Like their last gummy smile before their first tooth or the last crawl before they start walking. Knowing when to hold on, when to let go. It&#8217;s a gentle reminder that it&#8217;s all a process. Growing, letting go, and starting again. And this is why motherhood is like tree pose to me!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://honeykidsasia.com/hari-raya-aidilfitri-singapore/">Hari Raya Aidilfitri in Singapore: What you can do during the month of Syawal</a></p>
<p>So you’ve pulled through the whole month of <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/ramadan-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ramadan</a> – well done! Now’s the time to celebrate Eid ul-Fitr, AKA Hari Raya Aidilfitri or Hari Raya Puasa in Singapore. This month-long festival marks the end of fasting and encourages forgiveness and thanksgiving. Don&#8217;t mistake it for the Muslim new year, though, because it&#8217;s not. Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the Hari Raya celebration in Singapore.</p>
<h2>All you need to know about Hari Raya Aidilfitri in Singapore</h2>
<h3>What is Hari Raya Aidilfitri?</h3>
<p>Hari Raya Aidilfitri, or Hari Raya Puasa, is a significant occasion for Muslims, as it marks the end of the fasting month. It&#8217;s a time for forgiveness, as folks offer their apologies for wrongdoings committed in the past year. Family and friends also get together to strengthen their bonds and remember those who have <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/how-to-talk-to-kids-about-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed on</a>. The celebration is more commonly known as Hari Raya or just Raya in Singapore. The term &#8220;hari raya&#8221; means &#8220;day of celebration&#8221;.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Hari Raya isn&#8217;t a celebration of the Muslim New Year! In fact, Hari Raya Puasa falls on the first day of Syawal, the tenth month in the Islamic calendar. This year&#8217;s celebration will take place on <strong>Wednesday, 10 April 2024</strong>.</p>
<h3>What are the standard Hari Raya greetings?</h3>
<p>The most common (and traditional) greeting that Muslims in Singapore use is &#8220;Selamat Hari Raya&#8221;, which means &#8220;Happy Hari Raya&#8221;. This is sometimes followed by &#8220;maaf zahir dan batin&#8221;, which loosely translates to &#8220;I seek forgiveness from you&#8221;. Some folks also use &#8220;Eid Mubarak&#8221; to greet each other.</p>
<h3>What happens on Hari Raya?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_172513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172513" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-172513 size-medium" src="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/malay-boy-hari-raya-honeykids-asia-900x643.jpg" alt="Hari Raya Singapore malay boy" width="900" height="643" srcset="https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/malay-boy-hari-raya-honeykids-asia-900x643.jpg 900w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/malay-boy-hari-raya-honeykids-asia-768x549.jpg 768w, https://static.honeykidsasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/malay-boy-hari-raya-honeykids-asia.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-172513" class="wp-caption-text">Green packets are often handed out during Hari Raya Aidilfitri.</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the morning of Hari Raya Aidilfitri, family members seek forgiveness from their elders after prayers at the mosque. A tradition observed by most families is wearing <a href="https://honeykidsasia.com/hari-raya-fashion-for-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baju kurung or baju melayu in the same colours</a> to symbolise unity, which we find absolutely adorable! Oh, and little ones often receive green packets of money.</p>
<h3>What else can you see during Hari Raya?</h3>
<p>Muslims are big on decorations, so you&#8217;ll see plenty of Hari Raya adornments in their homes. You can often see colourful fairy string lights on the windows of Muslim households too – make a game of it with the kids the next time you&#8217;re driving around the neighbourhood at night, and see how many of these &#8220;lampu lap-lip&#8221; you can spot! Other decorations include &#8220;Selamat Hari Raya&#8221; cutouts, ribbon ketupats, the crescent moon and star garlands. Of course, what&#8217;s Hari Raya without the delicious spread? You can easily spot hearty dishes such as beef rendang and <em>sayur lodeh</em> alongside goodies like pineapple tarts, <em>kueh bangkit</em>, and <em>kueh makmur</em>.</p>

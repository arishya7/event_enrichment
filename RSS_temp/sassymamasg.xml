										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>“The experience left her shaken, questioning whether she had somehow failed her child—if only because her daughter had come to expect this kind of behaviour from boys as just another part of growing up.”</h2>
<p>A friend of mine shared her 13-year-old daughter’s unsettling experience–one that I cannot shake. A 13-year-old boy from her daughter&#8217;s tuition centre began sending sexually suggestive content to her—content she ignored and refused to watch. Instead of respecting her silence, he lashed out, insulting her for not engaging with what he&#8217;d sent. Worse still, he shared her phone number, exposing her to unsolicited messages from strangers.</p>
<p>When she finally confided in her mother, another unsettling revelation emerged. Prior to this, she had also received inappropriate messages from the son of a family friend. Their conversations over WhatsApp had been ordinary—until, suddenly, and without warning, he sent a crude and explicit message asking if she wanted to have sex, followed by emojis with unmistakable sexual connotations.</p>
<p>I thought that felt uncannily similar to the Netflix series <em>Adolescence</em>, where seemingly harmless emojis take on entirely different meanings among teenagers—ranging from casual insults and subtle flirtation to references to human genitals.</p>

<h2>“She assumed this was normal behaviour for boys”</h2>
<figure id="attachment_231659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-231659" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-231659" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/teenager-unsolicited-explicit-texting-1.jpg" alt="Teenager texting - unsolicited explicit texts " width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/teenager-unsolicited-explicit-texting-1.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/teenager-unsolicited-explicit-texting-1-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/teenager-unsolicited-explicit-texting-1-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-231659" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Marc Clinton Labiano via Unsplash</figcaption></figure>
<p>When my friend asked her daughter why she had never mentioned either incident sooner, her response was heartbreaking: because of the earlier experience, she had simply assumed that this was normal behaviour for boys.</p>
<p>In the first case, the boy’s school was informed, and he was counselled. While my friend could have pursued formal action—after all, these were clear instances of sexual harassment, and her daughter is a minor—she ultimately chose not to, given that the school had intervened.</p>
<p>The second case was more complicated. When my friend confronted the boy’s mother, she was met with complete denial. The woman insisted that her son would never do such a thing and claimed that he had been asleep at the time the messages were sent. The boy later offered an excuse of his own, saying his phone had been hacked—an explanation that felt far too convenient.</p>
<p>Though my friend has since cut ties with this family, she hopes the incident at least compelled the mother to have an honest conversation with her son about the gravity of such actions—whether she believed him or not.</p>
<p>Through it all, my friend remained a steadfast source of support for her daughter. Still, the experience left her shaken, questioning whether she had somehow failed her child—if only because her daughter had come to expect this kind of behaviour from boys as just another part of growing up.</p>

<h2>Who’s at fault?</h2>
<figure id="attachment_231661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-231661" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-231661" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/teenager-unsolicited-explicit-texting-adolescence.jpg" alt="Teenager unsolicited explicit texting - Adolescence" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/teenager-unsolicited-explicit-texting-adolescence.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/teenager-unsolicited-explicit-texting-adolescence-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/teenager-unsolicited-explicit-texting-adolescence-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-231661" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Netflix Adolescence</figcaption></figure>
<p>After sharing my friend’s story, I know there will be those who default to victim blaming, questioning whether the girl had somehow encouraged these boys or if her clothing suggested something inappropriate. But the truth is simple—she did nothing except exist as a girl.</p>
<p>Instead of blaming victims, shouldn’t we be asking why these men and boys perpetrate violence against women and girls? Why is it that women cannot trust men—or even boys—to behave with decency and respect? To trust that they will keep their hands to themselves, that they won’t resort to harassment or assault? If men were better raised and educated on gender equality and respect, women wouldn’t have to live in fear of being harassed, molested or attacked by men.</p>
<p>In Singapore, more than 460 young people aged 19 years old and below were <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-460-youth-arrested-for-sexual-crimes-in-2024-sexual-penetration-of-minors-most-common-offence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested for sexual crimes in 2024</a>. The Ministry of Home Affairs noted that early and repeated exposure to pornography may affect young people’s understanding of healthy relationships, while inappropriate and inaccurate information could lead to distorted perceptions about sexual activities.</p>
<p>Last year, Singapore’s police force pegged <a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/-/media/B6A0F742EF084ADAB6FEBB4513A7813B.ashx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voyeurism and outrage of modesty</a> among top crimes of concern in the country. Voyeurism cases rose by 9% to 519 cases in 2024. and despite a slight decline in outrage of modesty cases by 6.6% to 1,427 cases, the police noted that the offense remains a serious concern.</p>
<p>Concerns over gender-based crimes are not just limited to Singapore. In fact, the rise in violent crimes against women in the UK was a key motivator for Stephen Graham and Jack Thorne to write <em>Adolescence</em>.</p>

<h2>What are boys learning?</h2>
<figure id="attachment_124261" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124261" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-124261" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/smsg-kids-cell-phones-090516.jpg" alt="Kids playing on cell phones - cell phone, tweens and phone, teens and phone, cyber bullying, pros and cons of kids cell phone, mobile phones" width="700" height="534" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/smsg-kids-cell-phones-090516.jpg 700w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/smsg-kids-cell-phones-090516-300x229.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/smsg-kids-cell-phones-090516-100x76.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-124261" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Pinterest &#8211; Image for illustrative purposes only.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The most unsettling part of my conversation with my friend wasn’t just the harassment her daughter endured—it was the fact that the boys responsible were only 13 years old and that begs the question: what have they been learning? That sending unsolicited sexual content is acceptable? That violating boundaries somehow earns them admiration? Where did they even get these ideas?</p>
<p>The answer, more often than not, lies in the internet, social media, and even pornography—digital spaces that shape attitudes in ways many parents fail to recognise until the damage is done.</p>
<p>I had hoped that movements like #MeToo had led to a deeper understanding of consent and respect, that parents were actively educating their children, that the world was shifting toward greater empathy and equality. But clearly, that isn’t happening fast enough, or at least, efforts have seemed to be stymied by the influence of toxic public figures.</p>
<p>The reality is, we are raising children in an era drastically different from the one we grew up in. When I was a teen, a phone call from a boy used to require passing through the filter of my parent answering the house line. Now, social media bombards children with questionable content, and instant messaging gives them direct access to people—both familiar and unknown—without oversight.</p>
<p>While public figures like Andrew Tate—the self-proclaimed misogynist who has more than 10 million followers on X and who was also mentioned in <em>Adolescence</em>—<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64125045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play a significant role</a> in spreading misogynistic rhetoric, the responsibility does not rest solely on them.</p>
<p>Parents, too, must be accountable, much like Jaime’s parents in <em>Adolescence</em>, who, in the gut-wrenching final scene, are left grieving in their son&#8217;s empty room. His father’s words—&#8217;I should have done better&#8217;—serve as a painful reminder that vigilance, education, and involvement in a child&#8217;s life are crucial long before tragedy strikes.</p>

<h2>What are parents to do?</h2>
<figure id="attachment_141885" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141885" style="width: 725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-141885" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/teen-using-phone-night-sleep-tips.jpg" alt="teen on phone sleeping tips" width="725" height="565" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/teen-using-phone-night-sleep-tips.jpg 725w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/teen-using-phone-night-sleep-tips-300x234.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/teen-using-phone-night-sleep-tips-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-141885" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Getty Images</figcaption></figure>
<p>So parents, be present, engaged and vigilant with your children. Monitor what your children are exposed to—check their phones, their online interactions. This isn’t a violation of privacy; it’s responsible parenting. As children transition to secondary school, they gain more independence, but they still need guidance, especially when navigating peer influences and digital spaces.</p>
<p>And have the honest, hard conversations with your children. After watching <em>Adolescence</em> and hearing my friend’s story, I shared them with my daughters, teaching them how to respond if they ever face similar situations. Most importantly, I reminded them that their mum and dad will always stand by them and do what’s right.</p>
<p>Parents of boys, you have the power to shape the future of gender equality. It begins at home with the examples you set and the values you instil. Teach your sons that respect for women is not just about obeying laws—it’s about integrity, empathy, and recognising women’s equal worth in all aspects of life.</p>
<p>Parents of girls, your daughters must understand their right to set boundaries, to call out inappropriate behaviour, and refuse to suffer in silence. &#8220;Boys will be boys&#8221; is not an excuse for harassment—it is a dangerous dismissal of actions that can escalate into serious wrongdoing.</p>
<p>For too long, safety has been placed squarely on women—on their choices, their movements, their clothing—rather than men’s accountability. The real shift must come from educating children before they adopt distorted views of masculinity and sexism. Real safety will only exist when men and boys take responsibility for ensuring they do not inflict harm.</p>

<h2>2. Analogue: Plant-based food</h2>
<figure id="attachment_174420" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174420" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-174420 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vegetarian-restaurants-singapore-Analogue-vegan-restaurant.jpg" alt="vegetarian restaurant singapore - Analogue vegan restaurant" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vegetarian-restaurants-singapore-Analogue-vegan-restaurant.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vegetarian-restaurants-singapore-Analogue-vegan-restaurant-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vegetarian-restaurants-singapore-Analogue-vegan-restaurant-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-174420" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Analogue</figcaption></figure>
<p>Analogue doesn&#8217;t just do smashing plant-based food (think jackfruit tacos, mushroom croquettes and plant-based nuggets), they also have a lovely cocktail selection that can be made non-alcoholic if you&#8217;re not in the mood for something boozy. Their flavour-filled plant-based plates will satisfy even the biggest meat lovers.</p>

<p>Ananda Bhavan is one of the oldest vegetarian restaurants in town, serving traditional Indian vegetarian dishes. There are now multiple branches around Singapore, all dishing out North and South Indian vegetarian meals. Think Biryani set meals with vegetable kurma, raita, and <em>vadai</em>, or masala <em>thosai</em> and chaats.</p>

For a full sensory experience, head behind the Scented Sphere where you’ll be surrounded by the fresh scents of herbs and spices essential to Peranakan cooking, like pandan and lemongrass.

<p>One of the perks of living in a multicultural and multilingual country like Singapore is the easy access to bilingual education. Being bilingual has been shown to have massive social and cognitive benefits as well, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583091/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies have shown</a> that people who speak multiple languages have better attention spans and multi-tasking abilities, starting from as young as seven months of age! Some <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-international-schools-singapore-secondary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international schools</a> and preschools in Singapore offer bilingual immersion programmes for languages such as French, Mandarin, Japanese, Spanish and more. Others have dual language teachers or co-teachers who provide equal language interaction throughout the day or even dedicated language classes. Want to find the right bilingual school in Singapore for your child? We&#8217;ve rounded up a list of bilingual <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-international-schools-singapore-secondary/">international schools</a> and preschools to help get you started.</p>

<p><strong>Bilingual school languages: </strong>Mandarin and English</p>
<p>As a leading expert in multilingual education for children aged nine months to 18 years, EtonHouse International School has nurtured numerous cohorts of fluent bilingual speakers, many of whom come from non-native Mandarin-speaking backgrounds. In the early years, EtonHouse offers two well-established pathways to build a strong foundation in Mandarin. The trusted EtonHouse ZhongHua Full Mandarin Immersion Programme and the bilingual programme offer students a rich learning experience so they can effectively master both English and Mandarin.</p>
<p>At the primary level, EtonHouse Broadrick’s Mandarin Immersion Pathway is aligned with the IB Primary Years Programme and is designed to develop bilingual, culturally competent, and internationally-minded students by the end of Year 6. Notably, Year 5 and 6 students achieved an impressive 84% average in the 2024 Level 4 Youth Chinese Test—a strong testament to the programme’s success in fostering bilingual proficiency. Mandarin is woven into everyday learning, routines, and cultural experiences, allowing students to explore the language through meaningful, real-world contexts while building fluency and confidence.</p>

<p>Brighton College (Singapore) offers two languages: Chinese (Mandarin), French and Spanish.

<p><strong>Bilingual school languages: </strong>French-English and Chinese-English programmes</p>
<p>For the past decade, Canadian International School (CIS) in Singapore has been a global leader in bilingual education. As one of the most experienced and trusted international schools in the region that offers <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-cis-chinese-english-bilingual-programme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">award-winning</a> bilingual programmes, they empower students to become fluent communicators in at least two global languages. From Kindergarten to Grade 6, CIS offers both Chinese-English and French-English bilingual programmes, fully aligned with the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP). Each class is taught by two native-speaking educators, so students benefit from equal exposure to both languages in a balanced 50:50 model. Its research-driven approach, developed in partnership with local and international universities, is grounded in the understanding that language fluency is incomplete without cultural literacy.</p>
<p>Students in Grades 7 to 10 can also benefit from the bilingual pathway in an expanded model. Learning is further enriched through drama and overseas trips that help develop advanced literacy and critical thinking skills in both languages while immersing in culture. 35% of CIS Class of 2024 graduates earned the prestigious IB Bilingual Diploma, which goes to show that CIS’s bilingual model prepares globally competent, bi-literate and bicultural learners who are ready to lead in an increasingly globalised world.</p>

<p><strong>Dual language school languages: </strong>Mandarin and English</p>
<p>Affectionately referred to as DUCKS, the experienced educators at Dulwich College (Singapore) believe that it is crucial for young children to be exposed to more than one language. Their Dual Language environment supports children&#8217;s cognitive and social development by simultaneously nurturing English and Mandarin, daily. Every class has a native Mandarin-speaking teacher who works closely with the native English-speaking class teacher to ensure that children are consistently exposed to two languages throughout the day.</p>
<p>In the Foundation Stage, teachers use a child-initiated play approach and encourage meaningful interactions in both languages. For little ones in Pre-Nursery, the primary goal of the Dual Language programme is for students to be proficient in understanding and speaking English and Mandarin in social and learning contexts by the end of Year 2. As such, students from Reception to Year 2 also have daily differentiated Mandarin lessons for up to an hour.</p>

<p><strong>Bilingual preschool languages:</strong> Mandarin and English</p>
<p>ChildFirst Preschool offers a unique bilingual programme that immerses children in both English and Chinese daily. Each day is divided equally between both languages, allowing children to absorb and acquire both languages naturally during their most receptive years. The English programme builds a strong foundation through phonics and reading. By age five, children are introduced to literature, expanding their vocabulary and comprehension by exploring various genres. The Chinese Rapid Word Recognition (快字通) programme uses rhymes and word families to teach Chinese characters, making learning effective and enjoyable.</p>
<p>To prepare children for a tech-driven future, ChildFirst integrates artificial intelligence into its curriculum. In English, children co-create storybooks with a child-friendly version of ChatGPT, alternating between AI-generated and child-written sentences. They illustrate their stories and enhance them using DALL·E, an AI image tool, sparking creativity and digital literacy. For Chinese, a customised AI app tracks each child’s progress and personalises learning through games, media, and rewards. This adaptive approach strengthens retention and engagement. ChildFirst’s bilingual programme not only nurtures strong language skills but also equips children with the creativity and confidence to thrive in a multilingual, AI-powered world.</p>

<p><strong>Bilingual preschool languages:</strong> French and English</p>
<p>Les Petits Gaulois is a French-English bilingual preschool that integrates language, exploration and play in a fun and stimulating environment. Children are exposed to both French and English through structured lessons, creative play and project-based learning under the guidance of French-native educators. What parents love most about this bilingual preschool is their purposeful outdoor learning space. From gardening to nature walks and collaborative outdoor projects, children can connect with nature, ask questions and explore the world with all of their senses.</p>
<p>The school follows the French National Education curriculum, enriched by its unique 4C framework: Curiosity, Confidence, Creativity and Continuity. Students will also learn Mandarin as a third language through dedicated enrichment sessions. Classes are kept small so that each child gets the personalised attention they deserve. Understanding that it takes a village to raise a child, this bilingual preschool partners closely with families to support each child&#8217;s learning journey. After children graduate from Kindergarten 2, they can enjoy a seamless pathway to primary schools such as the International French School (IFS). Book a tour today to discover how their nature-inspired approach and bilingual programme can help your child thrive.</p>

<p>The Night Safari offers a real-life adventure for kids whose favourite bedtime book is the classic Dear Zoo. But unlike the world-class <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-visit-singapore-zoo-kids-animals/">Singapore Zoo</a>, this after-dark safari offers the whole family a magical glimpse into the world of nocturnal animals. Spot stealthy predators, glowing eyes in the dark, and animals you’d never catch awake during the day–all from the comfort of the open-air Night Safari tram. From ticket promos and Night Safari shows to behind-the-scenes zookeeper talks, here&#8217;s our review of Night Safari Singapore, plus how to make the Night Safari with little ones magical–and meltdown-free.</p>

<p>The Night Safari Singapore is a refreshing twist on the usual zoo experience: no blazing sun, no sweaty midday meltdowns, just the cool night air and softly lit trails winding through lush, jungle-like habitats. It&#8217;s your chance to see nocturnal animals in action, from prowling predators to curious critters you’d never spot during the day.</p>
<p>We find getting around the park easy, especially with a toddler in tow, with the complimentary tram ride. It cruises through themed zones inspired by far-flung regions like the Himalayan Foothills and Nepalese River Valley. Want a closer look? Hop off and explore the four walking trails–they’re wide, well-marked and surprisingly stroller-friendly. If you ask us, it&#8217;s a night-time outing that’s wild in all the right ways. If you’re wondering how long you need to explore the Night Safari, you can expect to spend about two to three hours here, including the tram ride, walking trails and Night Safari shows.</p>

<p>When it comes to exploring the park’s grounds, choose from four walking trails: Leopard Trail, Pangolin Trail, East Lodge Trail, and Wallaby Trail.</p>
<p><strong>Leopard Trail:</strong> Easily the most thrilling of the four trails, the Leopard Trail takes you through dense jungle and rugged terrain–all with stroller-friendly elevated boardwalks and cleverly lit enclosures. You&#8217;ll stroll by leopards on the prowl and lions lounging under the moonlight. Don’t miss the walk-through bat and civet exhibits, where it’s all eyes on you!<br />
<strong>Animal sightings:</strong> Clouded leopards, Asian lions, civets, flying foxes, eagle owls</p>
<p><strong>Pangolin Trail (formerly Fishing Cat Trail):</strong> For something a little more elusive, head down the fully sheltered Pangolin Trail, where typically shy creatures come out to play. Winding paths lead you through tropical foliage to see everything from critically endangered pangolins to fishing cats.<br />
<strong>Animal sightings:</strong> Sunda pangolins, fishing cats, giant flying squirrels, Malayan porcupines, owls</p>
<p><strong>East Lodge Trail:</strong> This short but memorable trail gives you a front-row view of some of the Night Safari’s larger residents. Keep your eyes peeled for Malayan tigers pacing in the dark and Asian elephants enjoying a quiet moment. You’ll also spot red river hogs and spotted hyenas along the way – all without straying too far off the main route.<br />
<strong>Animal sightings:</strong> Malayan tigers, Asian elephants, red river hogs, spotted hyenas</p>
<p><strong>Tasmanian Devil Trail (formerly Wallaby Trail):</strong> Step into the Aussie outback – no passport needed. This easy, breezy loop brings you up close to Tassie devils, wallabies, and sugar gliders as they come to life in the evening. It’s a hit with little ones, thanks to the gentle path and laid-back vibes.<br />
<strong>Animal sightings:</strong> Tasmanian devils, wallabies, brush-tailed possums, sugar gliders, North Island brown kiwi</p>

<p>We got a 20-minute crash course in nocturnal wildlife at the Creatures of the Night show.

<p>With little ones in tow, this nocturnal wildlife park is magical, but it certainly pays to plan ahead. Here are a few tips to keep things smooth, fun, and meltdown-free.</p>
<p><strong>Arrive early and fuel up:</strong> Get there before the gates open at 7.15pm. Our suggestion? Either have an early dinner or eat at the Night Safari so you&#8217;re ready to go. There are lots of family-friendly options, but snaking queues build up fast.</p>
<p><strong>Get the kids to nap beforehand: </strong>You&#8217;re going to be spending at least two to three hours exploring the Night Safari, which means the kids will be up later than usual. If you&#8217;re heading over with younger kids, make sure they have a good, long nap in the afternoon so you can avoid overtired meltdowns.</p>
<p><strong>Hop on the tram before tackling walking trails:</strong> The complimentary tram is the best way to kick off your Night Safari adventure, especially with younger kids. The 30-minute ride is smooth, scenic, and takes you past big-ticket animals like elephants, lions, and Malayan tapirs. It also gives everyone a chance to settle in and soak up the atmosphere before exploring on foot. Bonus: Little ones often find the gentle motion and forest sounds soothing.</p>
<p><strong>Prep like a pro:</strong> Pack the essentials for the kids: comfy shoes, snacks for a quick energy boost, water to stay hydrated, and insect repellent (those mozzies are sneaky). A portable fan can be a lifesaver in the queues, especially in the heat. Dress in lightweight clothes for the humidity, and don’t forget to keep that mosquito spray handy if you&#8217;re exploring the trails.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace the darkness–safely:</strong> It’s all about the night-time vibes, so expect dim paths and just the glow of moonlight. Keep a close eye on kids, hold their hands while walking through the trails, or hand out glow stick bracelets for fun and easy spotting. No flashlights needed (or allowed), you just need an adventurous spirit!</p>

It&#8217;s also perhaps the most affordable trampoline park in Singapore we&#8217;ve found so far!</p>

<p>Trampoline parks in Singapore don&#8217;t get any better than BOUNCE Singapore, which features a massive, multi-national team of super enthusiastic young staffers, along with five dedicated trampoline areas based on interests and level of ability. Highlights at this indoor Singapore trampoline park include the <em>Leap of Faith</em>, the popular <em>Slam Dunk</em> area, and the super-fun <em>X-Park</em> obstacle course. There’s much emphasis on freestyle jumping (because why just jump up and down when you can bounce off the walls?), and a wide variety of programmes for littlies. BOUNCE Singapore even offers dedicated hours just for junior jumpers who are under 110cm, but can walk unassisted). Due to their strict safety policy, BOUNCE Singapore requires that everyone wear their special grip socks at $3.</p>
<p><strong>Trampoline park Singapore price:</strong> From $19 for the first hour; $15 for the second hour</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-superpark-review-indoor-play-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuperPark</a> is a great <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-indoor-playgrounds-babies-toddlers-kids-activities/">indoor playground</a> for <em>all</em> ages, kids and adults. It&#8217;s not a dedicated trampoline park but instead, it offers many activities all in one space (as well as trampolining). The trampoline area comes with a foam pit, so you can somersault with ease! Do note that kids need to be at least 120cm for this trampolining activity! SuperPark offers two levels of unlimited activities and aside from the trampoline area. It has a Pedal Car Track with tricycles, popular ball games like SuperBall and BaseBall, interactive games like SuperHoop, and more. <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-superpark-review-indoor-play-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here for a complete breakdown of everything fun at SuperPark!</a></p>

<p>Also technically an <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-indoor-playgrounds-babies-toddlers-kids-activities/">indoor playground</a> rather than a dedicated trampoline park, SkyPark @ Orchard Cineleisure has a super fun trampoline section with lots of bouncy activities for kids. We absolutely love the velcro wall where the kiddos will 100% try to get stuck as high as possible. Kids can also test their aim by bouncing and throwing a ball into a wall with holes to score points! Then, of course, enjoy the other adventurous zones around the playground, including high elements and obstacle courses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>“Kids here really get to be kids&#8230; Preschool is all about play, and kids spend loads of time outdoors—the Swedish attitude is “there’s no bad weather, only bad clothes.” The focus is on emotional growth, independence and just letting them enjoy childhood, which is such a breath of fresh air compared to the very structured, achievement-focused system I grew up with.”</h2>
<p>Singaporean mum-of-two, Hana Yusof, lives in Järfälla, a suburb in the Stockholm region, Sweden, with her Swedish husband Erik Sahlström. Hana, who works in tech, met Erik in Singapore when he was DJ-ing and she was working 18-hour days&#8211;she says she had to drag him back home to Sweden! They’re now happily living a slower, more balanced outdoorsy life, spending a lot of time on the slopes with their two kids, Hugo, who is 12 years old and Maya, 9. One of the biggest pluses of life in Sweden? The work-life balance, where Hana says, “People here really respect personal time, and there’s no pressure to always be ‘on’. I used to feel like if I wasn’t constantly productive, I was falling behind. Life in Sweden helped me understand that rest is just as important as ambition.’ We chat with Hana about her experience of giving birth and raising kids in Sweden, and how life abroad has given her a deeper understanding of what it means to be Singaporean.</p>

<p><em><strong>When did you move to Sweden and what were the reasons you decided to move there?</strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-231608" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof.jpg" alt="Overseas mama - hana yusof - sweden" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>We moved to Sweden in 2012 for the amazing weather… just kidding! I was born and raised in Chai Chee, Singapore. Erik is Swedish, but at the time, he’d been living the good life in Jakarta, Bali, and Singapore for about 10 years as a DJ. We actually met in Singapore when he was studying at the School of Audio Engineering (SAE).</p>
<p>The move was mainly about wanting a better work-life balance. I was running my own design agency back then, and 18-hour workdays were pretty standard. I couldn’t see myself keeping that up with a family in the picture. Erik was perfectly happy in Singapore—I kind of had to drag him back home to Sweden! But in the end, it turned out to be the best decision for us. Now we’ve built a life here that’s active, outdoorsy, and way more balanced (even if I still miss my hawker food!).</p>
<p><em><strong>Favourite aspect about living in Sweden?</strong></em></p>
<p>What I love most about living here is the quiet, humble, nature-loving vibe. Life feels slower in a good way, and we spend so much time outdoors as a family—whether we’re snowboarding, hiking, or just hanging out in the forest.</p>
<p>The work-life balance is a big one, too. Coming from the super fast-paced lifestyle in Singapore, it was such a refreshing change. People here really respect personal time, and there’s no pressure to always be “on.”</p>
<p>And I really appreciate how everyone gets a fair shot here—no matter your race, religion, or income level. There’s a strong sense of equality, and that kind of environment feels really good to raise a family in.</p>
<p><em><strong>And the worst part?</strong></em></p>
<p>Definitely November. It’s dark, grey, and feels like the sun disappears for the whole month—it’s a real mood.</p>
<p>I also really miss my family and my old, true friends back in Singapore. That kind of connection is hard to replace. While we’ve built a lovely life here, it’s not the same as having those people who’ve known you forever just a short drive or MRT ride away.</p>
<p>And honestly, no one really “passes by” Stockholm. Friends and relatives are always popping over to London or Paris, but Stockholm isn’t exactly on the way to anywhere, so we don’t get many spontaneous visits!</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you think parenting (and schools) in Sweden differs from Singapore? What do you appreciate most about it?</strong></em></p>

<p>Kids here really get to be kids. There’s a lot less pressure—especially in the early years. The focus is more on emotional growth, independence, and just letting them enjoy childhood, which is such a breath of fresh air compared to the very structured, achievement-focused system I grew up with.</p>
<p>Preschool is all about play, and kids spend loads of time outdoors—rain, snow, sunshine, it doesn’t matter. The Swedish attitude is “there’s no bad weather, only bad clothes.” My kids have built snow forts, climbed trees in the rain, and they just get so much out of that connection with nature.</p>
<p>When it comes to academics, it’s way more relaxed. There are only mandatory national exams in Grades 3, 6, and 9—and even then, there’s no class ranking. No top student lists, no scores published publicly. Most of the time, kids don’t even know how their classmates did, which really removes that competitive pressure.</p>
<p>If a child needs more help or extra challenges, there’s support either way. It’s not one-size-fits-all, and that’s something I’ve really grown to appreciate. It helps the kids feel safe and confident, and actually enjoy learning. Teachers here are also really approachable. It feels like you’re working with them, not just being told what to do as a parent. They know the kids well—not just academically, but who they are as people. Education is totally free all the way through university, and yes—if they go on to higher studies, they actually get paid to do it. That still amazes me.</p>
<p>On top of that, kids are treated equally no matter their background, which makes it feel really inclusive.</p>
<p>But what I love most is the freedom. The freedom to grow at your own pace, to be a kid, to figure out who you are without all the pressure. It’s such a gift, and I’m really grateful our kids get to experience that.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you find is the hardest part of being a parent living in a foreign country?</strong></em></p>
<p>The hardest part has definitely been the lack of babysitting or close-by family support. When the kids were younger, Erik and I barely had date nights.</p>
<p>His parents live seven hours away, and while we’re grateful for the rare visits from either side of the family, we had to make the most of those precious days—cramming as many date nights in as possible. It made us more independent, but it wasn’t easy in those early years.</p>
<p><em><strong>Were your kids born in Sweden? Anything stand out?</strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-231606" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-3.jpg" alt="Overseas mama - hana yusof - sweden" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-3.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-3-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-3-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>Yep—both Hugo and Maya were born in Sweden, and childbirth here was almost free! I had a c-section with Hugo and a natural birth with Maya, so I got the full experience.</p>
<p>With Maya, I had terrible back pain in the last months—I could barely walk. Thankfully, I was able to take parental leave before giving birth. In Sweden, we get 480 days of leave per child to split between parents. It’s not a big payout, but it covers the basics, and more importantly, there&#8217;s no pressure to rush back to work.</p>
<p>Erik got 10 paid days off right after the birth, which was a lifesaver. And honestly, I was kind of relieved not to be in Singapore during the newborn stage. Back home, you usually get a “confinement auntie” who moves in, cooks you “healthy Asian food” (read: fried chicken wings), and takes over the baby while the husband disappears into the background—because you’re seen as too “fragile” or “unpure” to do much.</p>
<p>In Sweden, it’s real teamwork. Just me, Erik, a tiny baby, and a whole lot of trial and error. It wasn’t always easy, but I’m really glad I did it this way.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tell us about your career pre- and post-kids</em></strong></p>
<p>Before kids, I was running my own design agency in Singapore. It was intense—late nights, weekends, never really switching off. Everything was about the next pitch, the next client, the next project. How many deals could I close? How much money could I make? That was the measure of success.</p>
<p>I used to think my career was the most important thing—what drove me and gave life meaning. And while I still care a lot about doing work I enjoy, becoming a parent and moving to Sweden really shifted my perspective. Work is important, but it’s just one part of life—not the whole thing.</p>
<p>Here, no one really talks about how much they earn (which makes sense because income tax is so high—you’ve got to be really earning to live flashy). Instead, people focus on whether you enjoy your job. The mindset here is: if you’re fulfilled, success will follow. And that balance has shown me what truly matters—my well-being and my family.</p>
<p>Now Erik and I both work in tech, and we’re lucky to have flexible jobs. We work from home a few days a week, take turns doing drop-offs, managing training schedules, squeezing in a quick run or climb, and logging back on in the evenings if needed. It’s not always calm, but it works for us.</p>
<p>Every time I go back to Singapore and see friends with helpers—doing laundry, cooking, and especially scrubbing toilets—I get a little envious. That is true luxury. But hey, I’ve learned how to clean bathrooms between meetings. It’s not glamorous, but it gets done—and it&#8217;s oddly satisfying.</p>
<p>And honestly, I’m grateful for being Singaporean and for my early career experience. Singapore gave me a strong foundation—the drive, the discipline, the attention to detail—and that stays with me. Most people I’ve met here know how successful Singapore is, and whenever I mention my background, it’s met with a lot of respect. It’s something I’m really proud of.</p>
<p><em><strong>We love how your family leads such an active life—tell us about that.</strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-231607" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-4.jpg" alt="Overseas mama - hana yusof - sweden" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-4.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-4-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-4-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>We’re 100% addicted to adrenaline. We all snowboard and Maya competes at the national level). Hugo has swim competitions and his own teenage life in Stockholm, so Erik and I take turns. One of us stays back with Hugo while the other takes Maya up to the mountains.</p>
<p>Erik runs marathons, and I go climbing plus I started gymnastics at 41 to improve flexibility and mobility for snowboarding—yes, I can do front flips now, and I still get a rush just thinking about it.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I tried springboard diving for a season just for fun, and unbelievably, Maya picked it up too. Now she trains diving three times a week and competes whenever snowboarding takes a back seat.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is there something you do to keep your children in touch with their Singaporean roots?</strong></em></p>
<p>We visit Singapore every year, and I teach them the basics of Malay culture and Islamic traditions—like greeting elders with salam, using the right hand to receive things, calling adults “auntie” or “uncle,” and even basic prayers, which they can recite by heart. I’m really proud of that.</p>
<p><em><strong>On raising multilingual children…</strong></em></p>
<p>It’s a chaotic mix! Erik speaks Swedish with the kids, and we speak English with each other. I speak Bahasa with them (except when I’m angry or in a rush!). They usually reply in English or Swedish, but they understand everything.<br />
They know both formal Bahasa Indonesia and even Bahasa Melayu pasar when I speak with my mom. Honestly, we might need to find a new secret language soon—they&#8217;re catching on to everything!</p>
<p>What’s the first thing you do when you land in Singapore?<br />
Eat, obviously! First stop: roti prata with dalcha—with my hands, of course. Then it’s pandan waffles or pandan chiffon cake from a bakery under an HDB block. And nasi padang&#8230; I dream about it. The second we land, it’s straight to the food.</p>
<p><em><strong>Top five places in or around Sweden for parents with kids:</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>1. Stockholm</strong>: Super stroller-friendly, easy to get around, lots of free museums for kids. Great halal, Asian, vegetarian and vegan food options.<br />
Favourites: Junibacken, Skansen, Vasamuseet, Tekniska Museet, Gamla Stan.</p>
<p><strong>2. Åre:</strong> Take the overnight train from Stockholm and wake up in a snowy mountain village. Slopes for all levels, sledding, great food. Kids love it!</p>
<p><strong>3. Malmö:</strong> Diverse, relaxed, and just across the bridge from Copenhagen. Good halal food, parks, beaches, and indoor play spaces.</p>
<p><strong>4. Gothenburg:</strong> Friendly vibe. Home to Liseberg amusement park and Universeum science centre. So many play cafés!</p>
<p><strong>5. A nature cabin getaway:</strong> Rent a simple cabin by a lake, BBQ, hike, pick berries. The kids love the freedom and fresh air is next level.</p>
<p><strong><em>What’s the local cuisine like and do you eat out or cook at home?</em></strong></p>

<p>We mostly eat at home. Contrary to what people might think, we don’t eat Swedish meatballs every day! They’re more of a special occasion dish. What really stands out in Swedish food culture is the obsession with sauces. There’s a sauce for literally everything. Bearnaise sauce here is what chilli sauce is to Singapore—essential, and goes with way more things than it probably should.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget fika. Swedes are obsessed with it. At around 3pm every day, offices pause for coffee and something sweet—usually cinnamon buns, carrot cake, or kärleksmums (a kind of chocolate coconut cake).</p>
<p><em><strong>What’s the one thing you would miss about Sweden if you moved away?</strong></em></p>
<p>Oh, so many things. But if I had to pick just one—it’s the space. The quiet, the nature, the ability to breathe. We’ve got forests right outside the city, lakes around every corner, and trails you can run without seeing another person for half an hour. That kind of stillness is rare and so calming.</p>
<p>I’d miss the seasons—especially winter. I know that sounds crazy to some people, but I honestly can’t imagine life without snow now. Snowboarding every weekend, the crisp cold air, running in the woods while everything’s covered in white—it’s become our rhythm as a family. It’s our happy place.</p>
<p>And then there’s the work culture. I love that people actually log off at 4pm to pick up their kids, that fika breaks are sacred, and no one expects you to be constantly reachable. The balance here has taught me so much about what really matters—my well-being, time with my kids, and not feeling guilty for resting.</p>
<p>I’d also miss how grounded and humble everyday life is. No one here cares what car you drive or what brand your clothes are. It’s about enjoying the small things—like grilled sausages by a frozen lake, hanging laundry in the summer sun, or walking barefoot on warm rocks by the water.</p>
<p>And I know the kids would miss it too. They’ve grown up snowboarding, biking to school, jumping in lakes after dinner. They have so much freedom here. They know the woods like their backyard, and they’re used to fresh air, open skies, and seasons that change the world around them.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you dread and look forward to most about moving back to Singapore?</strong></em></p>
<p>If my parents ever needed me, I’d be ready to move back. I’m prepared to do that when the time comes—family comes first. But after being away for 13 years, I honestly don’t know how I’d adapt.</p>
<p>I’d definitely look forward to being close to my family and lifelong friends again. There’s comfort in being around people who’ve known you forever, and I know the kids would love having their grandparents and cousins nearby. And of course—Singapore’s unbeatable when it comes to convenience and food.</p>
<p>What I’d miss is the space, the quiet, and the slower rhythm we’ve gotten used to here. Life in Sweden is more relaxed, and I’m not sure I’d easily adjust to the fast-paced energy again. My kids have grown up with so much independence and freedom here—I think it would be a big change for them too. Also, let’s be honest&#8230; I’m not sure I’m ready for that full-body humidity again!</p>
<p>So while I know I’d go back in a heartbeat for my family, I also know it would be a huge adjustment—for all of us.</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you think Singaporeans can benefit from living overseas?</strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-231605" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-6.jpg" alt="Overseas mama - hana yusof - sweden" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-6.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-6-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/overseas-mama-hana-yusof-6-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>Living overseas challenges you in ways you can’t really prepare for—it pulls you out of everything that feels familiar and safe. But in that discomfort, you grow. You question things you always took for granted. You learn how other people live, think, and raise their kids. It gives you perspective—on your own country, your culture, and yourself.</p>
<p>It also teaches you to slow down. Coming from Singapore’s fast-paced lifestyle, I used to feel like if I wasn’t constantly busy or productive, I was falling behind. Living in Sweden gave me space to breathe and helped me understand that rest is just as important as ambition. I left for a better balance. I stayed for the peace. And along the way, I found out who I really am outside the noise.</p>
<p>And strangely enough, being far away has made me appreciate Singapore even more. The food, the warmth of the people, the shared cultural shorthand that only Singaporeans really get—I didn’t realise how much that mattered until I was no longer surrounded by it.</p>
<p>For many Singaporeans, living overseas can spark a journey with identity. You might go through phases of feeling disconnected from your roots—maybe even embarrassed at times, trying to blend in or not stand out. But over time, there&#8217;s often a rediscovery. A deeper understanding of what it means to be Singaporean, and pride in where you come from. That’s been true for me, and I’ve seen it happen to others too. I hope that by living this way—blending cultures, staying curious, and keeping our roots alive—we&#8217;re also showing our kids that they don’t have to choose just one version of themselves. They can be both. They can be all of it.</p>
<p>And hopefully one day, they’ll look back and feel proud of every part of who they are. Living overseas doesn’t make you less Singaporean—it just gives you more layers. It expands your worldview without erasing your roots. We’ll always be a little torn between two homes, but honestly, I think that’s a beautiful kind of privilege.</p>

<p>Wondering what to do this weekend in Singapore? Geocaching involves finding treasures (called geocaches) hidden by fellow geocachers–you find the clues to where each treasure is hidden using the GPS on your mobile phone. All you’ll need to do is download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.groundspeak.geocaching.intro&amp;hl=en_SG&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow">Geocaching app</a> (the basic access is free), look for a geocache near you and start hunting. Once you find the treasure (which is often a small waterproof container containing a piece of paper where those who found it can write their name) you rehide it in the same place and log your find on the app. Geocaching is a fun way to get the kids out in nature and explore your neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Toa Payoh Dragon Playground has to be one of THE most iconic outdoor playgrounds in Singapore! The dragon head is tiled with terrazzo and tiles while the body is made of colourfully painted steel rings, which children can climb through.

This free outdoor playground offers some climbing fun, a slide and a sandpit to dig around in. We reckon it&#8217;s worth heading here for some selfies for nostalgia&#8217;s sake!</p>

Kids of all ages will go crazy for the tilting train that features a series of climbing tunnels (it can be a bit scary for kiddos under 3, though). You’ll also find multiple slides, swings, a flying fox, and a spinning merry-go-round. Be sure to bring buckets and spades, as there’s lots of sand play area for digging and sand castle building, too. The outdoor playground is in the middle of Tiong Bahru Park, which is fairly compact but has a lovely gazebo, some big steps for climbing, and a few paths that are perfect for scooting. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1vUd-7yu3j/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch our video here</a>.</p>

<p>East Coasters rejoiced when this huge outdoor playground opened in <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-east-coast-park-guide-bike-rental-food/">East Coast Park</a> in 2016. At <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/marine-cove-playground-east-coast-park/">Marine Cove Playground</a>, there are both big kids and toddler play areas, and all manner of cool climbing structures, swings (including multiple accessible swings) and slides. The highlight at this playground is the 8-meter high lighthouse tower that’s accessed by various rope ladders (and features 3 slides to get down). We also give a thumbs up for the handy kids’ toilets and showers on the premises, and have a feeling your children will love the adjacent McDonald&#8217;s… Fair warning though, this outdoor playground can get very crowded on weekends!</p>

<p>10/10 points for free outdoor playgrounds that are sheltered! The Sky Terrace open-air playground at Level 2 Our Tampines Hub is a blessing for rainy days or extra-sunny days.

We&#8217;d say that the Sky Terrace playground is more suitable for younger kids, with a toddler-friendly slide and plenty of exploration stations. There&#8217;s also a trampoline and some spinners. However, rest assured that older kids will still have a ball of a time running around this spacious area!</p>

<p>Primary 1 is a big year for families, but it all starts the year before, when the Primary 1 registration exercise begins. Fret not, our comprehensive guide has all you need to know about the P1 registration exercise for local primary schools. Families interested in registering their <strong>children born between 2 January 2019 and 1 January 2020</strong> (both dates inclusive) can now mark their calendars for the P1 registration exercise that begins on <strong>1 July 2025</strong>, for the academic year of 2026. All 2025 P1 registrations will be conducted online, as it was in the past years, and there will not be any in-person registration at schools.</p>
<p>The Primary 1 registration exercise is conducted over several phases. Phase 1, 2A, 2B and 2C Supplementary apply to children who are Singapore Citizens (SC) and Permanent Residents (PR). Phase 3 is for international students. If your child is Singaporean or Permanent Resident and has an older sibling already enrolled in a local primary school, parents are required to submit an application directly to the school from 9am on Tuesday, 1 July 2025 to 4:30am on Thursday, 3 July 2025 (Phase 1 of the 2025 P1 registration process). The primary school where the older sibling is currently studying will provide parents with more details on how to register their younger child.</p>
<p>For Phases 2A, 2B and 2C, the link to the online form and user guide will be available on the MOE P1 Registration <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/registration-phases-key-dates?pt=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> during the registration periods of the respective phases.

<p><strong>1. After registering interest in June 2025 what comes next?</strong></p>
<p>In <strong>October 2025</strong>, families selected by MOE as eligible to register will be contacted to bring ALL original documents listed below <em>in person</em> to a designated school for verification. Take note that <strong>both parents’ <em>original </em>passports and identity cards will be required </strong>so manage travel plans accordingly. More info on documents needed <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/international-students/receive-offer-letter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. How can I update my child’s vaccinations and check what is required?</strong></p>
<p>Regarding vaccinations: To update all vaccination records, you can scan and email all vaccinations along with the child’s FIN number, full name to the Health Promotion Board at <a href="mailto:hpb_nir@hpb.gov.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hpb_nir@hpb.gov.sg</a>.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.nir.hpb.gov.sg/nirp/eservices/immunisationSchedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to see the Singapore vaccination schedule</a></em></p>
<p><strong>3. How can I improve my odds of getting a spot in a local school? </strong></p>
<p>Admission to local schools for foreigners (children without PR or citizenship) is decided at the discretion of the Ministry of Education. All families can do is follow the process by the deadline, submit the required documentation, and hope for a favourable outcome.</p>
<p><strong>4. I hear that even if I am PR, I won’t get a spot in a local school.</strong></p>
<p>This is untrue. All children holding PR or citizenship are <strong>guaranteed</strong> a spot in a local school. Be sure to review the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/registration-phases-key-dates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registration by phases to learn the steps</a> required if your child is not a foreigner.</p>
<p><strong>5. How do I get into a “good school” as a foreigner? </strong></p>
<p>Admission to local schools and choice of schools for foreigners (children without PR or citizenship) is decided at the discretion of the Ministry of Education.</p>

<p><strong>6. I am PR but my child is not, what do we do? </strong></p>
<p>You register during the Phase 3 registration as a non-PR foreigner. The immigration status of the child signals the phase of registration, regardless of the status of the parent.</p>
<p><strong>7. What if our application is denied? </strong></p>
<p>This is a likely outcome. All decisions are final and appeals are not considered. All families should prepare a backup plan for the education of their child should the local school application not succeed.</p>

<p><strong>8. Can I register next year?</strong></p>
<p>Foreigners wanting to register outside of the P1 registration phases will have to take a rigorous standardised test called the AEIS and admission is at the discretion of the Singapore government. For more information consult the Ministry of Education. <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/singapore-schools-international-students-aeis-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to read about</a> one mama’s experience when her son took the AEIS.</p>
<p><strong>9. I want to register my child for a local school, but they were not born between 2 January 2019 and 1 January 2020 </strong></p>
<p>Outside of the P1 registration, all foreign children applying for a local school must take the AEIS exam. Admission to the school is at the discretion of the Singapore government. For more information, consult the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/international-students" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ministry of Education</a>!</p>
<p><strong>10. What happens if I missed the phase my child is eligible for? </strong></p>
<p>You can still register your child in the next eligible phase, but there will be no priority given. If you missed the 2025 P1 Registration Exercise completely and do not have approval from the MOE for deferment, you can contact the MOE to enrol your child into a school with vacancies.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the <em>Future World: Where Art Meets Science</em> permanent exhibition comes to mind when one thinks of the ArtScience Museum. This stunning gallery was made in collaboration with teamLab Singapore–a well-known art and technology collective – and features engaging and enchanting digital installations crafted by combining art and technology. This digital wonderland aims to create a space for all ages where imagination knows no boundaries. Yes mums and dads, there’s fun for the adults too!</p>
<p>The exhibition just reopened its doors on 31 May 2025 after undergoing a revamp, and now features a more expansive space with new interactive installations! Starting with the very first installation you’ll see upon entry — Continuous Life and Death — you’ll be greeted by a breathtaking floral display that shifts with the light of day. The immersive experience extends to the digital floor, where flowers bloom and water trails follow your every step as you interact with the exhibit! Just be sure to save some space in your camera roll because there are plenty of photo-ops throughout the stunning exhibits of ArtScience Museum!</p>
<h3><a name="Slide"></a>Slide at Future World: Where Art Meets Science</h3>
<figure id="attachment_231826" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-231826" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-231826" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/artscience-musuem-future-world-water-droplets-copy.jpg" alt="artscience museum - future world exhibition" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/artscience-musuem-future-world-water-droplets-copy.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/artscience-musuem-future-world-water-droplets-copy-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/artscience-musuem-future-world-water-droplets-copy-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-231826" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: ArtScience Museum</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you continue exploring the Future World exhibition, be prepared to have your little ones (or yourself, we don’t judge!) jump with excitement as interactive installations are introduced. For one, there is a giant slide that you can take your shoes off and zoom down! The Sliding Through the Fruit Field now features an extension of Waterfall Droplets, Flowing Down a Slope, which depicts water cascading down a slope and breaking apart into single droplets that bounce when kids climb up the steps to reach the slide!</p>

<p data-wp-editing="1">For the little artists, the ArtScience museum features immersive drawing activities that allow you to get creative with your artwork and have it appear on the screen! <span style="font-weight: 400;">This one&#8217;s a big hit with the kids, so it might be difficult to get a spot for them to colour their artwork. But don&#8217;t worry, there are three different drawing themes available throughout the gallery to ensure every little Picasso gets a chance! We especially love Sketch Flight, which provides an added experience for you to control your artwork on the screen. This exhibition at the Future World, ArtScience Museum also got an upgrade, and now lets you experience the world from the perspective of aeroplanes and living creatures, including butterflies, hawks, and dolphins!</span></p>

<p>The last installation at Future World is its highlight, the Crystal Universe at the Future World exhibit. This installation enjoys its publicity on Instagram feeds and TikTok for its mesmerising display of light points that create an illusion of an infinite starry universe. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This installation at the ArtScience Museum proves itself as the best place in the museum to take photos, so dress accordingly and snap quickly before you have to move along for the next group to come through</span></p>

<h2>If you need help getting through life&#8217;s challenges, consult our list to find a therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist and other services for counselling and therapy in Singapore</h2>
<p>Looking for counselling or therapy in Singapore? Life can hit us hard sometimes, and it&#8217;s okay to ask for help! Whatever your mental health struggles are, know that you&#8217;re not alone and there&#8217;s much to be gained from counselling or therapy in Singapore. Counselling services can help you if you&#8217;re on the lookout for marriage counselling (<a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/parenting-child-with-autism-marriage-strain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this couple found having a child with autism put a strain on their marriage</a>), or whether you&#8217;d like to speak to a therapist to help with your self-worth, counselling for <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/postpartum-depression-in-singapore-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">postpartum depression</a>, a listening ear for your child or teen, or just someone to help your family navigate life harmoniously.</p>

<h2>Counsellor, Psychologist, Psychotherapist: Know the Difference</h2>
<p>Confused about the differences between a psychotherapist and a psychologist, counselling or therapy? Here&#8217;s a simple breakdown to get you started.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Counselling vs. therapy:</strong> These terms are often used interchangeably, but typically, counselling focuses on problem-solving specific issues that are happening to you in the present and is usually applied for shorter terms than therapy.</li>
<li><strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> This long-term, in-depth solution zooms into a wider range of issues, and involves dissecting your past experiences and childhood to find answers for your current behavioural patterns and issues.</li>
<li><strong>Psychotherapist: </strong>This umbrella term applies to any professional trained to treat people for their mental health, and can encompass psychiatrists, counsellors and clinical psychologists.</li>
<li><strong>Psychiatrists: </strong>These mental health experts have a medical degree and specialise in preventing, diagnosing, and treating mental illness. Unlike most psychotherapists, they can also prescribe medication.</li>
<li><strong>Psychologists:</strong> They usually have a Master’s Degree or PhD in psychology and talk therapy. They perform psychological testing and are qualified to do counselling and psychotherapy for mental disorders. A counselling psychologist will tend to work with clients with emotional and social issues, whereas a clinical psychologist will normally work with people suffering from more complex mental health conditions, such as personality disorders and major depressive disorders.</li>
<li><strong>Counsellors: </strong>They typically help clients explore the challenges or difficulties being faced, whether it&#8217;s dissatisfaction with life or even a loss of purpose.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cathy Livingston is an American who has lived in Singapore for 25 years. She offers therapy services in Singapore and has been in clinical work since 2010. Having worked with expats and locals aged 12 and above, Cathy is ever-ready and equipped to come alongside you and offer the support you need through therapy. She has clinical work experience in the areas of trauma and abuse, attachment injuries, depression, and anxiety. She offers traditional talk therapy sessions in the office or online. She is certified in Trauma Focused Equine-Assisted Therapy, EMDR, CTRT, and trained in TF-CBT. She also incorporates attachment theory into her work.</p>
<p>In equine-assisted therapy, you will partner with a horse to address areas where you may be struggling. As an individual who is hardwired for connection, there may be times when you feel like you have lost that connection with yourself, others and the world. As sentient beings who are also wired for connection, horses can help you discover familiar relational styles, ways of communication and familiar thoughts and feelings that may arise. This gives individuals a chance to experience new ways of being.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Discover how the International Community School’s Advanced Placement (AP) courses prepare students for university and beyond through rigorous, college-level academics &#8211; with students consistently outperforming global benchmarks!</h2>
<p>Looking for a school that equips your child with the right skills and foundation for university and beyond? Choosing the right school plays a big part in helping your child reach their full potential, and preparing them for success at the right university is just as important.</p>
<p>At the International Community School (ICS) in Singapore, students don’t just excel academically, they also grow into confident individuals who are prepared to thrive in any environment. With a globally recognised American curriculum, ICS equips them with the tools, values, and real-world experience they need to thrive.</p>
<h2>Recognising students&#8217; potential for academic success and beyond</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-228489 aligncenter" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/international-community-school-sportsa.jpg" alt="ICS" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/international-community-school-sportsa.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/international-community-school-sportsa-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/international-community-school-sportsa-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>ICS offers 25 <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-ics-ap-programme/">Advanced Placement (AP) courses</a> that challenge students with college-level academic work in high school. With an average score of 4 out of 5, ICS students consistently outperform global averages, giving them a competitive edge when applying to top universities. These strong results also often allow students to earn early college credit.</p>
<p>As the Class of 2025 prepares to graduate, their university acceptances reflect not just academic excellence but also personal growth and a readiness to lead in a rapidly changing world. This year’s seniors are heading to prestigious universities across the United States, United Kingdom, Asia, and more.</p>
<p>Alumni like Sann Nu Wai (PhD from Imperial College London) and Nathan Low, who has earned his B.A., cum laude, from UC Berkeley and his Juris Doctor (JD) from UCLA School of Law, further amplify that ICS prepares students for success in every field. Yushi Liao (Class of 2024) is studying Materials Science at City University of Hong Kong and contributing to sustainability projects. &#8220;ICS taught me that service is action,&#8221; she says, emphasising the school’s focus on purposeful learning.</p>
<h2>Personalised pathways with a supportive community</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-230212 aligncenter" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/international-community-school-supportive-community.jpg" alt="ics" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/international-community-school-supportive-community.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/international-community-school-supportive-community-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/international-community-school-supportive-community-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>At ICS, every student is encouraged to explore their passions and goals. With one-on-one academic counselling, students receive the personalised guidance they need to plan and prepare for university applications. A low student-to-teacher ratio also means students get the individual attention they need every step of the way.</p>
<p>The school&#8217;s supportive community doesn’t end at graduation, many ICS alumni stay connected to the community, with some even returning to teach, coach, and guide the next batch of students!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Does your little one often want to help out in the kitchen? KitchenAid&#8217;s newest Cordless Collection makes meal prep a breeze, even if it&#8217;s with the kids. Cook anytime, anywhere!</h2>
<p>Do you find yourself scrambling to get meals on the table after a long day at work? <a href="https://www.kitchenaid.sg/?utm_campaign=gocordlesslaunch&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_source=sassymama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KitchenAid</a> has just made life easier. The new KitchenAid Go Cordless Collection helps you prep, mix, and blend without worrying about power sockets or messy cords. Whether you&#8217;re making smoothies for the kids or baking treats together, these cordless tools offer the freedom to move around the kitchen with ease.</p>
<h3 data-start="496" data-end="545">Cord-free convenience with one powerful battery</h3>
<figure id="attachment_230555" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230555" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-230555" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Food-Chopper.jpeg" alt="kitchenaid go cordless collection - food chopper" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Food-Chopper.jpeg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Food-Chopper-300x233.jpeg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Food-Chopper-100x78.jpeg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230555" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: KitchenAid</figcaption></figure>
<p data-start="547" data-end="1078">The KitchenAid Go Cordless Collection includes four must-have tools for every kitchen: the Go Cordless Hand Mixer, Go Cordless Hand Blender, Go Cordless Food Chopper, and Go Cordless Personal Blender (USD$299 per appliance). Without cords getting in the way, you can cook safely and freely—perfect if the little ones want to help. These tools are designed to move with you, so you can meal prep wherever the kids need you. With simple controls and no setup hassle, they’re easy to use even during the busiest mealtimes. They’re also easy to clean, making post-cooking clean-up a piece of cake.</p>
<p data-start="1125" data-end="1636">One powerful 12-Volt lithium-ion battery (USD$99.90) powers the entire KitchenAid Go Cordless Collection. You can swap the battery between tools, so there’s no need to charge multiple devices or deal with clutter. The battery also includes a light indicator to let you know when it needs a charge, so you won&#8217;t have to worry about surprises in the middle of meal prep.</p>
<h3 data-start="1643" data-end="1667">Designed for a stress-free meal prep experience</h3>
<figure id="attachment_230556" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230556" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-230556" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hand-Mixer.jpeg" alt="kitchenaid go cordless collection - hand mixer" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hand-Mixer.jpeg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hand-Mixer-300x233.jpeg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hand-Mixer-100x78.jpeg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230556" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: KitchenAid</figcaption></figure>
<p data-start="1669" data-end="2260">We especially love the family-friendly features built into each tool. The Go Cordless Hand Mixer stands on its own to keep the beaters clean, and the Soft Start<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> prevents splattering–super handy when kids are helping. The Go Cordless Hand Blender comes with a blending jar and pan guard to protect your cookware, and the Go Cordless Food Chopper’s simple one-click bowl setup and whisking accessory make food prep quick and easy.</p>
<p data-start="1669" data-end="2260">For smoothie lovers, the Go Cordless Personal Blender&#8217;s powerful blade will instantly transform frozen ingredients into a delicious smoothie. Then simply pop on the travel lid and kickstart your day! Plus, every part that touches food is dishwasher safe, so you can say goodbye to doing the dishes at the sink and spend time doing what matters most.</p>
<p data-start="2303" data-end="2781" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With the KitchenAid Go Cordless Collection, making meals will quickly become a fun part of your family routine. These thoughtfully designed tools are safe, user-friendly, and powerful enough for everyday cooking. Plus, their sleek design and colour palette allow them to blend seamlessly into any kitchen. Explore KitchenAid&#8217;s Go Cordless Collection for yourself to discover how these kitchen tools will make your life <em>that</em> much easier.</p>

<h2>CUDO: Latin-American cuisine</h2>
<figure id="attachment_231310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-231310" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-231310" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/new-restaurants-singapore-cudo.jpg" alt="new restaurants in singapore - cudo" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/new-restaurants-singapore-cudo.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/new-restaurants-singapore-cudo-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/new-restaurants-singapore-cudo-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-231310" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: CUDO</figcaption></figure>
<p>CUDO is a new restaurant in Singapore that was opened by the same folks behind SIRI HOUSE and MOXIE! Serving up comforting Latin American food, CUDO aims to present a mix of creative spins and nostalgic nods to the well-loved cuisine.

<p>Ging Sun Ho King of Bun, a popular Shanghainese eatery in Hong Kong, was founded by former musician Oscar Siu. Oscar actually spent three years mastering the art of dumpling-making under a Shanghainese master! Starting with its first location in Mong Kok, the restaurant quickly became famous for its signature pan-fried pork soup buns.</p>
<p>Today, with over 13 locations in Hong Kong, the eatery continues to delight diners with its mouthwatering offerings like Shanghai Fried Noodles, Sichuan Dan Dan Noodles, and Soup Dumplings. Its expansion to Singapore marks its first international debut, and Singapore was picked because the country holds fond memories for Oscar, who spent a part of his childhood here!</p>

<h2>Sushi Ichinoji: Charcoal-grilled unagi &amp; fresh sashimi</h2>

<p>Located in Goldhill Plaza, the new Sushi Ichinoji may very well be a secret portal to Japan for your tastebuds. Over here, the charcoal-grilled unagi takes centre stage, as does the fresh seafood that&#8217;s flown in twice weekly from Japan. We tried these and suffice to say it did not disappoint.</p>
<p>The signature Unagi Hitsumabushi (from $34.80) is generously topped with grilled unagi, every piece promising a lightly crisp bite followed by the soft and tasty eel. You can eat it as-is, but we recommend having the last half with their homemade unagi broth to give the dish a sweet yet hearty kick. Raw seafood lovers will also love the Kaisendon ($68) which comes with 14 kinds of sashimi. It does come with a premium price tag but we say it&#8217;s worth it as the sashimi is extremely fresh, with uni, toro and ikura being the highlights of this dish.</p>

<p>Sushisamba is a hit in London, Las Vegas, New York and Dubai, and we now get our own Sushisamba in Singapore! Sushisamba is a fun combo of Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian-style cuisine with cocktails and music thrown in for good measure. Munch on Japanese tempura and sushi, Brazilian churrasco and moqueca and Peruvian ceviches. It&#8217;s all about high energy here (think Samba dancers and percussion musicians) as you watch the chefs in the open kitchen cook over the fiery robata grill, enjoy the beats and admire the 360-degree views of the cityscape.</p>

If you&#8217;ve been hankering after Filipino comfort food look out for hayop&#8217;s reinvented dishes divided into bites, mains, vegetables, and rice – as well as desserts – all served as small plates and great for sharing.</p>

In the kitchen are two female chefs &#8211; Benji Chew and Renee Tang who cook up what they&#8217;re calling &#8216;Singapore Soul Food&#8217; &#8211; a modern take on heirloom and heritage dishes including reimagined multi-cultural hawker dishes. The idea is to bridge generations, offering flavours that grandparents will recognise while making dishes interesting and fresh for the younger peeps. We love how central to Chef Dylan&#8217;s F&amp;B concepts is affordability.</p>

Our favourites were the Signature Hainanese Kampong Chicken with Scallion and Ginger Sauce ($15.90 half/$28.90 whole) with Triple L rice (a fragrant lard-topped rice dish). Think juicy poached kampong free-range chicken drizzled with a plate-licking sauce of house-blended soy sauce, scallion and ginger.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t miss the 16 Hrs Bone-In Coffee Angus Short Rib ($69 – 700-800g) marinated with spicy Vietnamese flavours then grilled and coated with a coffee umami glaze. Other dishes include Teochew Pork Leg Trotter Jelly ($8.90); Chef Benji’s Our Rojak Our Own Way ($8.90) (an interesting dish with rojak ice cream) and Coin Prata with Masala Lamb.

<p>Gu:um means “to grill” in Korean. This new restaurant focuses on grilling premium meats but it&#8217;s not your usual Korean barbecue joint. It&#8217;s the latest concept by chef Louis Han, of one-Michelin-starred Nae:um fame. Where Nae:um is more fine dining and hushed tones, Gu:um is vibey with tables close together and more of a bustling scene. Dishes are cooked over a modern charcoal grill in the kitchen (not at your table) &#8211; from fresh seafood ($56 for five red prawns), to the beautifully tender Tajima wagyu ribeye ($188 for 280g) and deliciously succulent Iberico pluma ($118 for 300g).</p>

<p>Aside from the signature grilled dishes, a real highlight is the reinvented Korean street food &#8211; the yukhwae jeon ($32) fried potato pancake topped with hand-chopped beef tartare, the Cinderella Noodles (cold glass noodles in gochujang and sesame oil) and the unusual desserts are worth saving room for too.</p>

<p>It seems we can&#8217;t get enough of <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/eat-pizza-pasta-italian-restaurants-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Italian restaurants</a> on our little red dot. Fortuna Singapore is a new Sicilian-Neapolitan restaurant, an Asian import of the Sydney establishment. Master pizzaiolo Giorgio Sorce, ranked #87 worldwide, is one of the owners so expect pizzas to be top-notch.</p>
<p>Pizza dough is first fermented for 50 hours in-house. Aside from the usual Margherita (from $23) and Diavola (from $25) pizzas, look forward to their famous Double Fried &amp; Baked Pizza (nope, don&#8217;t try Google the calories). The dough is first fried and then cooked in the oven for double the crunchy texture. Try the fried Truffle Anchovy pizza ($42) or the Gambero and Stracciata pizza ($38) topped with prawns, cheese, pesto, tomatoes, and cured egg yolk.</p>

<p>Dirty Supper is a fun new restaurant housed within the iconic Hua Bee Restaurant by night (by day, the 90-year-old noodle house takes over). If you&#8217;re after a restaurant with East London vibes (in the heat of summer) Dirty Supper is where it&#8217;s at. It&#8217;s a little grungy and edgy (read there&#8217;s atmosphere). Chef-Owner Peter Smit is passionate about grilling and whole-animal cooking and as such, expect dishes to sell out and the menu to change depending on the produce available for the day. Sit up close to the action at the counter if you can take the grill-heat and want to chat with the chef (there are only two seats here so it&#8217;s a coveted spot).</p>

<p>Nook is a new restaurant and bar that has just opened on Craig Road. Nook comprises multiple levels with a restaurant on the ground floor, cocktail bar upstairs and a member&#8217;s lounge on the top (with a virtual golf simulator and private bar). Nook restaurant is all industrial walls, gritty unfinished edges, a splash of modern art and low lighting. Chef-owner Koh Han Jie (who you may remember from Ce Soir) cooks up modern European cuisine with Asian accents.</p>
<p>Tuck into starters of oysters with mignonette granita ($8/each) and heirloom tomatoes, crunchy puffed quinoa and creamy burrata ($24). Mains range from the Mikan Sea bream with Garlic Shoots and Smoked Beurre Blanc to Aqina organic half chicken ($42) which is aged for seven days and arrives juicy (claws still intact) best paired with Koshihikari rice ($18) the chef’s reinterpretation of chicken rice, topped with torched chicken cockscomb.</p>

<p>One of Naples’ oldest and most esteemed pizzerias, L&#8217;antica Pizzeria Da Michele comes to Singapore! Wait, isn&#8217;t that&#8230;Yes! It is. L&#8217;antica Pizzeria Da Michele is <em>the </em>restaurant from the Julia Roberts film<em> Eat, Pray, Love</em>. There are over 100 branches worldwide now but this is the first outpost in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>They specialise in handcrafted <em>pizza a ruota di carro</em> which translates to wagon wheel pizza – a unique, classic Neapolitan-style pizza characterised by its extra thin dough with a diameter larger than the plate beneath it. L&#8217;antica Pizzeria Da Michele&#8217;s Margherita ($28) is made with tomato sauce, Agerola Fior di Latte and pecorino Romano DOP. While pizzas are the star of the show here, there&#8217;s plenty more on the menu from pasta like Orecchiette alla Positanese, to baskets of seafood Fritto di Mare ($26).</p>

<p>Bar Cicheti has had a makeover and is back to satisfy your wildest pasta dreams. The original design inspiration of 1960&#8217;s Venetian bacari is reimagined in decadent hues of burgundy, with vintage frames evoking a nostalgic charm. Chef-owner Lim Yew Aun and head chef Danny Ng have a new pasta-focused menu that really delivers on flavour. Nibble on Fried Sage ($12) as you sip on a Cacio e Pepe cocktail (or check out their impressive non-alcoholic pours). Don&#8217;t miss the Creamy Burratina with fermented cherries ($28), the frankly brilliant Black Squid Ink Spagettini with char-grilled rings of baby squid ($32) and of course the Tiramisu, light but heavenly.</p>

The new restaurant under Les Amis Group is helmed by Singapore-based head chef Naruki Ikeda. There&#8217;s a 6-month waitlist for chef-owner Ryujiro Nakamura&#8217;s Sushi Ryujiro Tokyo so if you can nab a seat at Sushi Ryujiro Singapore you can expect many of the same dishes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about exceptional ingredients with seafood flown in five times a week from Japan such as tuna from Yamayuki, one of the top tuna dealers in Tokyo’s Toyosu market. Only set menus are available. Lunch is $188++ and $288++; dinner is $288++ and $388++. When Ryujiro Nakamura visits, four times a year (or more if he finds a local girlfriend Chef jokes), the Chef Visit Menu will be $488++.</p>

<p>Chef X is a brand new initiative from Far East Organization. The new restaurant space at Clarke Quay Central seats just 24 and gives budding home-based chefs a platform to showcase their culinary talents in a fully equipped commercial F&amp;B. Similar to their Baker X concept, each resident chef will helm the restaurant for four or eight weeks. It&#8217;s a great opportunity for those new to the industry to see if they have what it takes (so go easy on them diners!) and you may just stumble on a new fave cuisine.</p>
<p>Kicking off the project is Royaleys Smoky Boat (26 April to 21 June 2024) offering banana leaf rice parcels topped with fish, prawns, soybean or chicken and accompanied by vegetable sides. Wanting Kimchi (1 July to 26 Augst 2024) will showcase her naturally fermented kimchi and banchan, followed by Popo’s Kitchen (5 September to 30 Oct 2024) with &#8216;grandma style&#8217; Chinese dishes.</p>

<p>Frankie &amp; Fern’s is a hidden rooftop cafe in Holland Village. If you haven&#8217;t spotted it and you live in the area, you&#8217;d be forgiven. It&#8217;s hidden on the fourth floor of Holland Village Shopping Centre. This light-filled cafe does brunch until 4pm offering up dishes like Frankie’s Breakfast ($26), of scrambled eggs, kale with feta, bacon and sausages; Fern’s Avocado Toast ($19) and the Roasted Short Rib Toast ($22) (go early for this as it often sells out by midday). If you&#8217;re here for dinner on Fridays through Sundays only, try the Grilled Tiger Prawns ($19) or Baby Squid with Aioli ($14), Butternut Pumpkin Rigatoni ($26) or if you&#8217;re feeling flush, the Short Ribs ($78).</p>

<p>Griglia Open Fire Italian Kitchen opens its second location, this time in the East. New restaurant Griglia Katong offers its signature charcoal-grilled Italian fare like the 30-day dry-aged Porterhouse “Fiorentina” and suckling pig porchetta cooked on the custom-made iron cast charcoal grill. The new menu is filled with offerings that celebrate Italy’s rich gastronomic heritage and great care has been taken to source much of the ingredients direct from Italy.</p>
<p>Start with Heirloom Tomatoes Carpaccio, freshly sourced from Sicily then move on to the moreish Fusilli Monograno Felice with crab and Calabrian spice, ‘Nduja. Other highlights include the wonderful Whole Spanish Turbot best enjoyed with a side of Kale in white balsamico and Potato Purée with horseradish. We usually always save room for Tiramisu (and this spot&#8217;s hazelnut rendition is great) but you must try their dessert cocktail Sgroppino &#8211; lemon sorbet topped with Prosecco!</p>

<p>Japanese omakase Chef Desmond Fong, whom you may know from Sushi Yujo, has opened a new restaurant that puts a modern twist on the sushi-izakaya experience. The decor is all sleek, modern furnishings with fun brightly coloured Japanese prints and neon signs. On the menu: aburi and charcoal-grilled specialities, sushi and mains from an affordable $6.80. The Japanese concept, omakase means &#8216;trust&#8217; the Chef with the food choice. Expect lots of luxe ingredients thrown in &#8211; from foie gras sushi, to Wagyu Foie Gras Don, Truffle Chawanmushi with Truffle Caviar, and signature rolls like the SHINRAI Royal Maki.</p>

<p>Kee’s is a new restaurant by Culinary Director Michelin-starred Andrew Walsh and Executive Chef Iswardy Hamzah. We love that it really doesn&#8217;t feel like a hotel concept despite being the in-house restaurant of new heritage boutique hotel 21 Carpenter. The kitchen is on display at the back, while the moody-lit restaurant is cleverly designed (by award-winning architectural firm WOHA) to have different seating offerings from high tables to cosy booths and larger tables for corporate groups.</p>
<p>The menu is a varied mix of modern European and Pan-Asian dishes. Highlights include the Tuna Tartare ($18) with Vietnamese coconut dressing and crunchy puffed quinoa, the stunning Beetroot Burrata ($20) and the Shrimp Cocktail ($18) served with prawn crackers.</p>
<p>A standout is the Pepper Crusted Ribeye Steak ($40) the meat served medium rare is melt-in-your-mouth tender and perfectly complemented by the creamy peppercorn sauce. We&#8217;d happily have a girls&#8217; dinner or date night here and we&#8217;ll certainly be back to check out the great value set lunch $36++/$40++ for 2 or 3 courses.</p>

<p>Looking for a new date night spot? Put Cote Korean Steakhouse, the first international outpost of the first and only Korean steakhouse with a Michelin star on your list. Hailing from foodie mecca, New York, Cote elevates the traditional Korean barbeque experience with elements from classic American steakhouses. Expect premium cuts of USDA Prime beef, Australian Wagyu and Black Angus, as well as an extensive Japanese A5 Wagyu selection.</p>
<p>Order your meat a la carte, or opt for the cheat sheet for the whole table with the Butcher’s Feast ($98++ per person) featuring four pre-selected beef cuts, alongside banchan and condiments. You&#8217;ll get your own personal server to cook your meats over the smokeless charcoal grills.</p>
<p>Contrary to the usual casual <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/best-korean-bbq-restaurants-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Korean BBQ spots,</a> Cote is all about classic luxury with moody vibes. The main dining room takes inspiration from the flagship in New York, with its dark green tones, marbled tables and plush booth seats.

There&#8217;s a resident Latin band nightly Tuesday to Sunday, dance lessons (just $15 per class) and a crazy good Ladies Night on Wednesdays (free freeflow on certain drinks!). Add in a daily happy hour from 5;30pm to 8:30pm (think 2 frozen margaritas for $18 &#8211; though if you like &#8217;em strong we recommend hitting the Passionfruit Caiprinha at $21 instead) and you&#8217;ve got yourself a Mexican party!</p>
<p>If you need to line your stomach, the Guacamole and Chips ($16) is bang on the money plus they have a selection of hearty Mexican dishes (look for their recommendations on the menu such as the Birria ($28) 48-hour slow-cooked lamb with Mexican chillies, crispy corn tortillas and mozzarella cheese or the Barbaca Tacos ($21) tender beef barbacoa with cheese in flour tortillas.</p>

<p>Little Island Brewing Co. a brewery known for its award-winning beers opens its first vintage vinyl bar at Gillman Barracks. Every Friday and Saturday, look forward to live band performances.

<p>If you love a bit of vinyl, don&#8217;t miss Waxy Wednesdays when old-school vinyls play retro music from the 70s and 80s from 7pm-10pm. Charcoal slow-fermented woodfired pizzas ($18-$28) are a hit, and there are very affordable dishes from Nasi Kerabu (weekends $8) to sharing bites of Chicken Wings ($10), Crispy Calamari ($15) and the highlight, Dukka Oven Roasted Cauliflower. The kids will definitely fight over the Sticky Date Pudding, just saying.</p>

<p>Air is one of the newest restaurants in Dempsey, and it&#8217;s a beaut! Air, short for Awareness, Impact and Responsibility, is a restaurant that also encompasses a cooking school, research space and garden farm. Established by celeb chefs Matthew Orlando and Will Goldfarb, and entrepreneur Ronald Akili (co-founder of Potato Head in Bali), Air has a mission: to inspire thought about food.</p>
<p>However, what they won&#8217;t be doing is preaching the hows and whys to you (unless you ask, then they&#8217;ll happily fill you in!). To get to Air, you&#8217;ll walk along a long wooden walkway that curves up into Dempsey&#8217;s lush greenery, where their herb and fruit farm is being nurtured to feed the restaurant. Plans are afoot for fun happenings on the lawn, and there&#8217;s seating on the steps but most will gravitate to the cooler indoors.</p>

<p>The menu is short and indeed thought-provoking. Only one meat (duck) and lots of fish and vegetable offerings. Start with Fermented Cassava Bread and Mushroom “XO” Butter ($16), then tuck into White Fish Ceviche with green mango, Kenari nut milk and emping crisps ($29). For mains, share Crispy Oyster Mushrooms with pickled chillies ($30) a moreish dish that almost mimics fried chicken.</p>
<p>The star of the show is the Whole Coral Grouper ($46). It&#8217;s not a whole fish served as you&#8217;d imagine. Instead, the fish head is made into a smoked rillette and served with lavish crackers (made from pressure-cooked fish bones), while the filet is confited and topped with black garlic vinaigrette. For dessert, don&#8217;t miss The Whole Papaya ($18) – panna cotta with papaya jam and shaved papaya skin granite topped with dried papaya seeds — one of the most unique desserts we&#8217;ve ever tried!</p>

<p>Tamba is the sister restaurant of the renowned Kafe Utu, the first African restaurant in Singapore. You&#8217;ll first see the red-earth-inspired exterior walls, and as you walk up the painstakingly decorated staircase (that is reminiscent of the mud architecture of Africa), you&#8217;ll emerge into a low-lit dining room with a cocktail bar that&#8217;s both glamorous and cosy. It feels like you&#8217;ve stepped into someone&#8217;s rather extravagant home with a dining area that can only seat around 20 guests.</p>
<p>The drop-dead gorgeousness of the decor is what will stay with you. Tamba pays homage to owner Kurt’s late brother who was West African, and the restaurant&#8217;s decor is a warm celebration of African heritage and style. Don&#8217;t miss a peak in the washrooms to spy the lurking crocodile!</p>
<p>The menu features homemade bread with Tapalapa, smoked bacon butter and ricotta goat cheese topped with smoked honey, Jollof Rice with Chicken and the highlight, a Prawn Pepper Soup, a Nigerian staple that’s got a real kick to it. Tamba also boasts a cocktail program composed of African spirits and led by GM Joma Rivera, previously from Kafe Utu and 28 Hong Kong Street. <a href="https://www.sevenrooms.com/reservations/tamba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reserve here.</a></p>

Executive chef Alessio Pirozzi, from Abruzzo, Italy will be cooking hand-made pasta ($36 – $48), seafood and meat dishes, as well as wood-fired pizzas ($32 – $58) if you&#8217;re going a la carte, but there&#8217;s also a six-course set menu to explore.</p>

<p>Tribal is a new modern Asian grill by homegrown F&amp;B company Ebb &amp; Flow (of restaurants Sommer and Willow). Located within Mondrian Singapore Duxton, Tribal spotlights wood-fired cooking and familiar Asian flavours. Start with scallops in homemade XO sauce ($35) or Yellowtail Sashimi ($26) tossed in a bright Sarawakian-inspired dressing of chilli, garlic and kaffir lime.</p>
<p>Mains feature wood-fired grilled meats such as Santori Organic Kampung Chicken ($42) with an Asian twist from the Gai Yang barbeque glaze, and seafood of Kymer Amok Prawns ($38) or Octopus with sambal bajak and papaya salad ($55).</p>
<p>We were most taken with the sides of Purple Sweetcorn ($12) and the clever Celeriac Mille-Feuille dusted with macadamia ($14) as well as signature sharing rice pots with a nasi ulam base of fluffy Thai Jasmine rice with fresh aromatic vegetables and herbs in three variants: wild mushroom, Wagyu and seafood.</p>

This new day-to-night nightlife and culinary destination spans Levels 61 and 62 of One Raffles Place.

<p>Fireside is a new restaurant bar concept by Panamericana, located in Quayside Isle, Sentosa Cove. There&#8217;s an alfresco seating area streetside but you&#8217;re going to want to head upstairs to the main bar to sink into the plush seats overlooking the yachts or perch up at the glitzy cocktail bar that takes centre stage.</p>
<p>The menu is designed with Small and Big plates so you can tuck into something hearty for lunch or dinner—think Beer Battered Snapper with Triple-Cooked Chips ($32), Whole Chicken ($52) or Australia Black Angus Ribeye, MBS 6+ 300g ($98) but we reckon this spot lends itself best to cocktails and bites.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t leave without trying the excellent Spice Spice Marg ($22) a heady cocktail of Codigo Blanco Tequila, Codigo Mezcal, Jalapeño and Cucumber juice, best washed down with the Sea Bream Crudo ($24) and Panamericana Sourdough ($8). If you&#8217;re in need of a private room know that they have an exclusive Tasting Room with a karaoke system and projector for those late-night lock-ins.</p>

At a weekday lunch this spot is crammed with hungry diners drawn by the affordable pricing and the lure of housemade pasta. Rigatoni with Guanciale, Egg &amp; Pepper is just $18; Spaghetti with Clams and Pancetta is $18 while the priciest pasta on the menu is Mafaldine with Spanner Crab is $24 (and it&#8217;s well worth ordering!).</p>
<p>As well as hearty plates of pasta there&#8217;s &#8216;Italian street food&#8217; of Roasted Cauliflower with garlic chilli, Calamari Fritti and meatballs. At lunch there&#8217;s Housemade focaccia to mop up your pasta sauce, while at dinner Grill items are available from Australian Grass-fed Rib Eye to Lamb T-Bone. The Pistachio Tiramisu is worth saving room for.</p>

<p>Liberty Singapore is a new smokehouse restaurant in the CBD. This HK import blends Asian cuisine cooked with wood-fire techniques of a Texas-style barbecue. The menu has a fun East-meets-West vibe. Think Korean kalbi-marinated whole rib ($32/100g) smoked for 12 hours in cherry wood then slow-cooked and served with spring onion salad.</p>
<p>Other dishes not to miss include the Short-Rib Dumplings ($22) in black vinegar and crispy chilli sauce, Prawn Tagliatelle ($32), the lighter Hamachi ($28) with mango Ponzu salsa, and the fun Corn-Rib ($16). This Whole Mexican white corn is fried, tossed in butter and curry spices — best eaten with your hands and dipped in the accompanying smoked hollandaise sauce.</p>

<p>Singapore only has a handful of Sri Lankan restaurants, so we were excited to hear about the opening of Kunthaville. Housed in a century-old colonial-style conserved shophouse, Kunthaville offers Ceylonese fine dining. The owner, self-taught cook, Kuntha, has a family tea estate in Sri Lanka and has been selling Ceylon tea since 1867.</p>
<p>The Sri Lankan fare here revolves around the Ancient belief of the six facets that balance life… sweetness, bitterness, astringent, spiciness, saltiness and sourness. Unlike many other Sri Lankan restaurants, some dishes are plated individually rather than sharing style. Starters range from spicy Beetroot Cutlets ($12) with mango avocado salad to Roasted Butternut Pumpkin soup with ginger and turmeric.</p>

<p>A real highlight is the Gundappam ($14, pictured) made from fermented rice batter. These mini appams are spongier than the usual appams or hoppers making them fun to dip into the Coconut Chambal ($14). The main of Coconut Rice is accompanied by Dry Jack Fruit Curry, Green Beans, and a few different chambals ($28). At this point, you may or may not have noticed a lack of meaty dishes. We certainly didn’t miss it, as the flavours and textures are so interesting.</p>
<p>Kunthaville is in fact largely vegan using coconut milk or chickpea milk instead of dairy, and there is no meat on the menu. The colonial-style setting is lovely, and we reckon this spot is worth checking out whether you have vegan friends to accommodate or just fancy some delicious Sri Lankan food in an upscale setting — there&#8217;s even a yoga room upstairs should you wish to have a wellness morning followed by lunch!</p>

<p>Dew by Whitegrass, is the casual off-shoot of the MICHELIN-starred Whitegrass restaurant located next door within CHIJMES. It’s all about small plates of European fare with an Asian twist to complement the sake bar. Nibble on sashimi like Chef Smoked The Salmon and Hamachi On The Way ($22) and tuck into morsels of brioche topped with prosciutto and stracciatella cheese ($15).</p>
<p>Other highlights include Hokkaido scallops with pickled tartar and lemon garlic soy sauce ($26) or for something heartier, the Yuzu Kosho Seaweed Pasta ($20). If you&#8217;re feeling flush, plump for one of the signature luxe items, the “R” IGA Ribeye, roasted IGA wagyu A4 rib eye with sauteed spinach and wasabi ($58). Swap your usual glass of vino for one of the curated selections of Sake labels, sourced directly from different prefectures in Japan.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If you love Kinki Restaurant + Bar at Customs House, you&#8217;re going to want to know about Ginkyō [pronounced as ‘Geen-keo’] by the same group at the new mall One Holland Village. Ginkyō redefines the Japanese dining experience with dishes that are primarily Japanese but with a cosmopolitan twist. Highlights for us were all from the Raw kitchen — featuring seafood from Tokyo&#8217;s iconic Toyosu Market (Kinki fans never fear their signature Rock &amp; Roll makis, which are on this menu too).</p>

<p dir="ltr">Award-winning steakhouse Bedrock has a new open wood-fired grill concept, Fireplace by Bedrock within the new pet-friendly mall that everyone’s talking about, One Holland Village. The open kitchen takes centre stage, and as the concept is open fire cooking, there are lovely woody aromas as the meats are grilled. Highlights include the Dirty Duck ($48) sous vide Irish duck rubbed in aromatic spices and then grilled, and the 6 Hours Wood-Fired Crispy Pork Belly ($35 for 200g / $48 for 300g), sous vide overnight, then slow-cooked above the grill, so the meat is tender. There&#8217;s a wonderful smokiness, and the skin is super crispy.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re fans of the lush spot in Demspey, Siri House, get ready for a great new restaurant by the same team. MOXIE is a &#8216;Modern Mediterranean dining destination inspired by coastal culinary journeys&#8217; in a bit of an odd spot — at the Medical Alumni Association Clubhouse just 5 minutes from Tiong Bahru.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re inside though, the hanging rattan lampshades, the muted earthy tones, jute rugs and the light breezing in through wide windows framed by tropical plants, transports you to Bali (aided by a cocktail or two). Dive into sharing platters of dips and warm pitta, then move on to stunningly plated Grouper Crudo ($25) drizzled with Zhoug coulis, pickled Japanese cucumber and diced red radish.</p>

<p>Little umami bombs like the Spanish salted cod Croquettes ($19) are just heavenly. For mains dig into Arugula Pesto Orecchiette cooked to perfection (<em>al dente</em> but not crunchy) flecked with crab, pine nuts and pesto. Each dish surpasses the next — particular mention goes to the Catch of the Day (200g- $39) in our case Golden Snapper with browned almond butter and crispy capers. Desserts are really something too — the Moxie Mille Feuille is not overly sweet, with whipped mascarpone sandwiched with berries in filo pastry and Kataifi (shredded pastry), and the &#8216;wow&#8217; dish is the Choc Mousse with hazelnut ice cream and a berry compote. One to add to your list!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a new restaurant to impress, put The Curry Club Signature on your hit list. This swanky new restaurant bar on Mohamed Sultan Rd, run by a local Singaporean Indian family, reinterprets Indian flavours into modern contemporary small plates and sharing platters. It has a great back story — the owner Mr Raj, a former Singapore Airlines cabin crew member, started selling local street snack vadai at night markets after being retrenched to feed his family of six.</p>
<p>Fast forward many years and his business grew to a mamak shop in 2006 and then a branch of different F&amp;B. The Curry Club Signature is helmed by Chef Saumya Prakash, who has 17 years of culinary experience spanning India, Dubai and the Maldives. The menu is a reinterpretation of classics, repackaged in a fun way — Dosa Cone Triplets ($13) come as mini cones on a stand with fillings of podi masala and a trio of colourful gravies.</p>
<p>Puri Bombs ($19) reimagine pani poori as little fried parcels encasing avocado relish topped with housemade pickled cucumber — a dainty, eye-catching dish that&#8217;s packed full of flavour! A standout is the Fire-Kissed Aubergine ($21), and don&#8217;t miss the FGRO Biryani ($37), a first-of-its-kind biryani experience featuring tender frog legs served with a side of refreshing beetroot raita and infused with apple wood smoke.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s presented with dramatic effect in a closed dish that lets a puff of smoke out once served! We&#8217;ll definitely be back to try more dishes &#8211; and if the mocktails are anything to go by, the cocktails will be Chef&#8217;s kiss!</p>

<p>New restaurant bar FURA is all about enjoying food and drink in a sustainable and environmentally conscious way with many ingredients foraged locally or grown by hydroponic farmers in Singapore. It&#8217;s helmed by Christina Rasmussen, head forager at three-Michelin-starred Noma and Sasha Wijidessa, previously the head bartender at Operation Dagger before working in Copenhagen where the couple met.</p>
<p>The space is intimate with the option to sit up at the counter where you can chat to Christina as she preps dishes. Go for a la carte or choose the six-course pairing menu at $145 which starts with a pretty dish called Weeds that features starfruit and foraged flowers and leaves. Next up, a delicate tart made with toasted kombu with a creaminess from blended lentils, topped with red radish — it&#8217;s a delight!</p>
<p>Portions are small (in line with waste not want not) so after the bread and dip course you&#8217;ll be ready for the star of the show — a steaming bowl of oyster mushrooms with black garlic caviar. A la carte dishes include This Hotdog Doesn’t Need To Explain Itself ($15) where a slow-cooked carrot stands in for a hot dog, topped with mustard aioli and new pickle relish.</p>
<p>Cocktails include the impressive Caviar Papi ($28) served with black garlic caviar and kombu ice cream or Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit ($24) made with Soka, tonka bean, peas and peas vermouth as well as a house-made butter bean koji.</p>

<p>It’s not often you come across a restaurant serving cuisine from Myanmar. New restaurant Burma Social promises traditional Burmese recipes elevated with modern infusions of its bordering Chinese, Thai, Indian, Bangladeshi and Laotian neighbours. On the menu, Burmese dishes such as starters of Lahpet ($18), a unique earthy and tangy salad prepared from freshly harvested tea leaves briefly steamed, then packed into bamboo vats and set in pits to ferment.</p>
<p>Mains comprise the Mohinga, a rice noodle and fish soup, considered by many to be the national dish of Myanmar, and sides like Tohu Fritters, and Hnin Si’s Steam Puzon ($32) where you get slices of fish cakes wrapped with rice paper and housemade Chilli.</p>

<p>Swedish chef Björn Frantzén and the team who brought us three Michelin-star fine dining restaurant Zén, just opened a new restaurant, Brasserie Astoria. It’s billed as more of an accessible brasserie but this is one fancy-pants dining establishment set in the iconic Victoria Concert Hall with its tall ceilings, low lighting and massive original colonnades. It&#8217;s a fun place to dine &#8211; think flambé trolleys (order the Whiskey flambéed Beef and choose between Angus $68 or Wagyu $110 to experience this in all its theatrical glory) and tableside service (Caesar salad).</p>

<p>Step into new restaurant Noa Lounge and be transported to the Med with its warm colour palette of ochres, greens and golds and stunning decor imported from Spain. A magnificent 4.5-meter-tall bar takes centre stage, while an open kitchen fosters a sense of connectedness between the chefs and guests.</p>
<p>Noa Lounge is set within the Mondrian Singapore Duxton Hotel, and is by the same team that brought us Olivia Restaurant just a few skips away. Helmed by award-winning Chef Alain Devahive (of Michelin-starred elBulli Restaurant, and Olivia Restaurant fame), Noa brings together mezze dishes from countries around the Mediterranean, drawing from Spain, Italy, France, Egypt, Lebanon, Turkey, and beyond.</p>

<p>Start with Hummus ($16), an unusual take on this dip with its addition of fresh sardines; the Noa ‘Bomba’ Crispy Meatball with Harissa and Allioli ($16), and a personal fave, the Burnt Cauliflower Salad with Dates ($23), a beautifully smoky creamy well-balanced dish. Order the basket of wraps and bread to mop up the sauces.</p>
<p>Mains include Charcoal Grilled Salmon with ‘Chraimeh’ Sauce ($37) and the Lamb Kofta with Fava Beans and Yoghurt ($35), although portions are on the small side so you&#8217;ll need to order a feast to share as they would do in the Med. With its combo of fab decor and fun vibes (a hidden DJ space awaits for &#8216;<em>those</em>&#8216; kinda nights) we reckon this is sure to be one of the hottest new restaurants in town!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a new Moroccan restaurant in town! Step into Tajine and you&#8217;ll be greeted by a palm tree, soft lighting, arabesque walls, and a playlist with North African beats to set the mood. It&#8217;s best to head to Tajine with a gang so you can order a bunch of sharing dishes and still have room for the tajines and pastillas (Moroccan savoury pastry pies).</p>
<p>Start with the Mixed Platter (from $36) featuring three or six dishes &#8211; not the usual hummus and dips but interesting sides like cooked carrot salad with chermoula and preserved lemons, ar’a m’asla roasted butternut pumpkin puree and grilled eggplant. The house-made woodfired pita and batbout (mini breads) are a must-order.</p>
<p>Larger sharing dishes include the Couscous Royal with lamb merguez, lamb chop, spring chicken, kefta, and chickpeas or order a tajine &#8211; there&#8217;s the Poulet Citron Tajine with organic free-range chicken or the Milk Fed Veal Shank Tajine with bone marrow, prunes, apricot and almonds. Don&#8217;t miss the fun signature Moroccan-inspired cocktails ($24 each) and if you can&#8217;t manage dessert make sure you end your meal with sweet Moroccan mint tea ($12).</p>

<p>Husband and wife chefs Daniel and Tamara Chávez (of CANCHITA Peruvian Cuisine) bring a new restaurant to Dempsey that you&#8217;ll need to book ahead for if you plan to visit! Tinto is their first Spanish restaurant as a couple and offers tapas, paellas, fideuàs and Spanish wines. It&#8217;s a lovely welcoming space (where Moonbow used to be) with indoor seating and a secret door at the back opening out onto a covered alfresco space that looks onto the green.</p>
<p>Signature dishes include the Tinto Paellas and Tinto Fideuàs, in two sizes and seven variations that are brimming with more ingredients than the typical. The De Pulpo &amp; Chorizo paella ($36/$68) consists of Bomba rice &#8211; the bottom crispy as it should be and topped with grilled octopus, sausage, chickpeas, and fava beans while the noodle paella Carabineros &amp; Setas Fideuà ($32/$58), impresses with Red Carabinero Prawns over short thin pasta noodles and mushrooms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the tapas that really stand out, however. Start with the refreshing chilled Gazpacho ($10) made with Heirloom cherry tomato and Japanese cucumbers, then share portions of the Gambas al Ajillo ($28) prawns cooked in roasted garlic oil with a moreish slick of smooth potato puree, the Pulpo a la Brasa ($28) is perfectly grilled Spanish octopus &#8211; tender with crispy edges &#8211; best enjoyed with a bottle of the delicious Adega Algueira Mencia 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>As parents, we want to support our kids the best we can. Finding the right help at The Learning Lab can make all the difference.</h2>
<p>If your child is in primary school, you’ll know that PSLE is a huge milestone for both the child and the parents. Effective PSLE prep can do wonders, not just to give your child a confidence boost, but also to allow parents to focus on being supportive. For many parents, <a href="https://www.thelearninglab.com.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Learning Lab</a> is the key to a smooth PSLE journey. With more than 20 years of experience under their belt, a thoughtful teaching approach that helps students build a strong academic foundation and a genuine love for learning, it&#8217;s no wonder so many families continue to return to The Learning Lab.</p>
<h2>A track record that speaks for itself – but it’s more than just grades</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-230027 aligncenter" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-01.jpg" alt="The Learning Lab - happy student" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-01.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-01-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-01-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>It’s the results that first catch our eye: 1 in 3 students scored AL1 in English, Math or Science in the 2024 PSLEs. Half of their students scored a PSLE Achievement Level of 8 or lower, and 60% scored AL1 or AL2 in the subjects they received support at The Learning Lab. But what sets it apart? They&#8217;ve got a magic spark that makes students excited to learn. Lessons at The Learning Lab aren’t about drilling information. Instead, they are crafted to spark curiosity and build deeper thinking. With resources like retrieval practices and error analysis worksheets, students become more independent and resilient, skills that will help them thrive beyond the exam hall.</p>
<p>Classroom materials at The Learning Lab are carefully crafted by 40 in-house curriculum specialists. Everything is aligned with the MOE syllabus, but it’s standouts like the “Staying Plugged In” (SPI) curriculum series that takes learning one step further. Real-world events such as Polling Day or the wildfires in L.A. are integrated into lessons, cultivating a global perspective in young learners to show them that what they are learning matters.</p>
<p>“My children look forward to their lessons every week,” says Mr Alvin Lian, dad of two students from The Learning Lab. “Often, they are excited to share the things they have learned from their lessons!” he explained, noting that he’s observed how his sons think critically and deeply about issues around them.</p>
<h2>Personalised teaching that meets your child where they are</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-230028 aligncenter" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-07.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-07.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-07-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-07-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>On top of their effective curriculum, the teachers at The Learning Lab take the time to understand the child, their learning habits, strengths and areas where they need additional support. It’s this personalised approach that can give your child the boost they need, not just academically, but in how they approach learning altogether.</p>
<p>As Primary 6 student Sarah Choong puts it, “I found the notes really helpful. One thing I really took away from my lessons with TLL was the importance of flexibility […] I realised that learning is not really about memorising. Even though I read as much as I could, what I really really appreciated [was] learning how to fit examples into my work in a proper way.”</p>
<p>With committed teachers, a well-designed curriculum and an environment that builds confidence, The Learning Lab helps students not just meet, but exceed their goals. And the shift in learning mindset? That’s priceless. If you’ve been looking for that extra edge and a place where your child will feel supported, challenged and inspired, look no further than The Learning Lab.</p>

<p>We were sad to see <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/directory/s-e-a-aquarium-at-resorts-world-sentosa/">S.E.A. Aquarium</a> go when our favourite aquarium closed its doors on 30 April 2025. But it wasn&#8217;t goodbye forever! In its place is the all-new Singapore Oceanarium, which is three times bigger than its predecessor. Good news, folks: it&#8217;ll be opening on 23 July 2025! That&#8217;s just before the <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-singapore-international-school-holidays-calendar/">school holidays</a> wrap, giving us something to pad the post-<a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-mid-year-summer-school-holiday-events-getaway-kids-free-fun/">June holiday</a> blues. With 22 zones to explore, families can look forward to some great new additions at the Singapore Oceanarium. We&#8217;re plenty excited about the prehistoric underwater world, the massive collection of sea jellies, the new walking net and its many new teractive elements. Read on to find out what to expect at the Singapore Oceanarium:</p>

<p>We absolutely loved spending the <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-weekend-planner-fun-activities-events-kids/">weekends</a> at <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/directory/s-e-a-aquarium-at-resorts-world-sentosa/">S.E.A. Aquarium</a> with its amazing floor-to-ceiling aquariums in 10 zones filled with colourful marine life and educational snippets. As part of Resorts World Sentosa&#8217;s (RWS) 2.0 expansion plan, S.E.A. Aquarium has been rebranded and revamped into the Singapore Oceanarium.</p>
<p>Are we sad to see S.E.A. Aquarium go? A little; but we&#8217;re also mega-excited about the new Singapore Oceanarium. The Singapore Oceanarium is now three times larger than its predecessor, with 22 zones that allow visitors to connect with the marine world. You can look forward to experiencing everything from life in the shallow waters to the deep sea, and get a peek into ocean life during prehistoric times, all the way to marine life as it is today!</p>

<p>Here are some of the highlights of the zones at Singapore Oceanarium:</p>
<p><strong>Ocean Wonders: </strong>We love how mesmerising sea jellies can be, and now you&#8217;re about to be wowed at one of the largest kreisel habitats in the world. The kreisels will house thousands of moon jellies!</p>
<p><strong>Singapore&#8217;s Coast:</strong> A tribute to our nation&#8217;s very own vibrant biodiversity, this zone features a mangrove-inspired landscape and interactive habitats that kids will love.</p>

There&#8217;ll be life-sized animatronics and replicas of majestic ancient creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Migrators: </strong>This zone highlights the open waters and its vibrant ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Open Ocean: </strong>Our favourite Reef Manta Rays and Zebra Sharks are back at the Open Ocean, where you can observe thousands of marine animals gliding by via a 36-metre-wide viewing panel.</p>
<p><strong>Whale Fall and Sea Mount: </strong>Families can learn all about marine protection initiatives and successful efforts that&#8217;ve taken place.</p>
<p><strong>Hallway of Hope: </strong>An educational experience where kids can learn how they can play their part in protecting and cherishing the world&#8217;s oceans.</p>
<p><strong>Spirit of Exploration:</strong> This zone will look familiar to those who&#8217;ve visited the Maritime Experiential Museum &amp; Aquarium at S.E.A. Aquarium. The Jewel of Muscat is still there for families to explore the ninth-century Arabian dhow.</p>

Here&#8217;s everything to know about the National Day Parade 2025, NDP Rehearsals and National Day events. From the National Day concert to flypast information, NDP celebrations at the Padang and Marina Bay on 9 August, fireworks, NDP heartland events and more!</h2>
<p>This year&#8217;s SG60 National Day Parade is promising to be the biggest yet! With the theme &#8216;Majulah Singapura,&#8217; the 2025 NDP will celebrate Singapore&#8217;s 60th birthday with the National Day Parade extending from the Padang to Marina Bay. This means stunning <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/whats-on-where-to-watch-fireworks-singapore-free/">NDP fireworks displays</a> across both areas, promising some of the biggest <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/whats-on-where-to-watch-fireworks-singapore-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NDP fireworks</a> yet. Plus, the festivities will kick off in the lead-up to 9 August with NDP events around Marina Bay, as well as at heartland locations around the island that follow after National Day. What makes this year even more exciting is its SG60 theme, its brand new NDP 2025 theme song &#8216;Here We Are&#8217;,  and more provisions in place to accommodate 200,000 more people for NDP 2025! Read on to find out more about the NDP rehearsals and what to expect at NDP 2025 from crowd favourites like the Red Lions, the Presidential Gun Salute, <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/whats-on-where-to-watch-fireworks-singapore-free/">fireworks</a> and much more.</p>

<p>There will be two venues to celebrate NDP 2025, the Padang and Marina Bay. While the main NDP parade will be held at the Padang, the shows at both locations will be synchronised, with spectators at both venues experiencing all the highlights at the same time! While the Red Lions perform their iconic parachute down into the Padang, viewers at Marina Bay will get to see naval divers descend into the Bay&#8217;s waters. There&#8217;ll also be light projections and <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/whats-on-where-to-watch-fireworks-singapore-free/">NDP fireworks</a> across the city for all to see, as well as LED screens at Marina Bay where viewers can watch the live broadcast from the Padang.</p>
<p>Look forward to other crowd favourite programmes such as the State Flag Flypast, the Presidential Gun Salute and more. NDP 2025 will also see the return of the mobile column that&#8217;ll showcase military vehicles and assets spanning from the air to the land and sea. This segment will also include an aerial flypast at the Padang and a maritime display at Marina Bay&#8211;a first for NDP!</p>
<p>Of course, we&#8217;re all looking forward to the show segment. Local icons including Kit Chan, Charlie Lim and Dick Lee will take the stage, presenting four National Anthem-inspired acts. For those at Marina Bay, there&#8217;s also a floating stage for expanded parts of the show, so you&#8217;ll be able to catch all the excitement in person!</p>
<p>NDP 2025 ticket balloting for the NDP preview and National Day Parade opens on 28 May 2025 at 12pm and closes on 9 June 2025 at 12pm. Note that only Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents can apply. Successful applicants will be notified between 20 to 25 June 2025.

<p>The NDP Rehearsals are nearly just as exciting as the National Day Parade itself! After all, you get to see all the action before everyone else. National Day Parade rehearsals and previews usually showcase all the good stuff we look forward to: fighter jets, the Red Lions, <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/whats-on-where-to-watch-fireworks-singapore-free/">NDP fireworks</a>&#8211;the whole works! You can also ballot for tickets for the NDP preview, or park yourself at one of our recommended <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/whats-on-where-to-watch-fireworks-singapore-free/">FREE fireworks viewing spots</a> to watch the sky light up!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re planning to watch the parade from the comfort of your home, good news! You might still catch the state flag flypast and F-16 jets making their rounds in the heartlands. The Fly Our Flag segment is a highly anticipated part of NDP each year, allowing viewers who are unable to attend the parade to still experience the NDP 2025 celebrations by spotting the majestic jets and helicopters in several neighbourhoods across Singapore.</p>
<p>Details of the NDP 2025 flypast have yet to be released, but here&#8217;s what happened last year&#8217;s two routes: The western route included Woodlands, Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Batok, Jurong, and West Coast, while the eastern route will cover Seletar, Sengkang, Punggol, Pasir Ris, Bedok, and East Coast. Meanwhile, six F-16 jets made their flypast over locations such as Clementi, Jurong West, Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Batok, Woodlands, Toa Payoh, Seletar, Punggol, and Bendemeer.</p>

Save room for the flaky sweet Baklava and a strong black coffee!</p>

<h2>Bollywood Farms: Organic Vegetables &amp; Fruits</h2>
<figure id="attachment_163776" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163776" style="width: 725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-163776 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/kid-friendly-urban-farming-singapore-bollywood-veggies-min.jpg" alt="urban farming singapore bollywood veggies" width="725" height="565" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/kid-friendly-urban-farming-singapore-bollywood-veggies-min.jpg 725w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/kid-friendly-urban-farming-singapore-bollywood-veggies-min-300x234.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/kid-friendly-urban-farming-singapore-bollywood-veggies-min-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-163776" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Bollywood Farms</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bollywood Farms (formerly Bollywood Veggies) is the place to be if you want to get your hands on fresh and organic vegetables, herbs, and fruits, including uncommon varieties like wintermelon, dill, breadfruit and butterfruit. Grown without the use of chemical fertilisers, pesticides, and growth hormones, this vegetable and fruit farm is probably most well known for the 20+ varieties of bananas they grow each year – and all are sweet, succulent and hand-selected by the co-founder too. Bollywood Farms also makes a good family field trip with independent and guided tours of the farm, hands-on horticultural programmes, and culinary classes all available for families to enjoy. Kids can have a go at planting rice (and getting all muddy in the process) and take part in other hands-on activities to understand urban farming better. An on-site bistro, <em>Poison Ivy</em>, and a culinary school set against the quaint backdrop of the quiet Kranji countryside make this a truly memorable vegetable farm visit.</p>

This vegetable and fruit farm even welcomes visitors, with their special programmes for school children, allowing little learners to learn first-hand about environmental conservation and the effects of organic farming.

If you&#8217;d rather tour the farm as a family, Green Circle is open to the public (you’re just asked not to disturb the farmers while they work!), although some areas are off-bounds to unescorted visitors.</p>

<p><strong>Forest Stream Trail outside Bird Paradise</strong></p>
<p>At the Forest Stream Trail, kids can learn about the riverine forest ecosystems as they climb onto logs and weave through the root-like structures inspired by mangrove forests. We love how parents can sit at the Starbucks next door and watch kids play in full sight!</p>

<h2>Highlights at Bird Paradise</h2>
<p><strong>Nine Walk-Through Aviaries at Bird Paradise</strong></p>
<p>A highlight of Bird Paradise is the nine walk-through aviaries with different habitats of the world and several bird species. Stroll through the dense African rainforests and South American wetlands to Southeast Asian paddy fields, Australian dry eucalyptus forests, and more.</p>
<p><strong>1. Bird Paradise: Hong Leong Foundation Crimson Wetlands aviary</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_189057" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189057" style="width: 721px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-189057 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bird-paradise-jurong-bird-park-2.jpg" alt=" Bird Paradise: Jurong Bird Park singapore Highlights, Ticket Promotions &amp; Playgrounds" width="721" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bird-paradise-jurong-bird-park-2.jpg 721w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bird-paradise-jurong-bird-park-2-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bird-paradise-jurong-bird-park-2-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-189057" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Beate Baldry</figcaption></figure>
<p>This was our favourite aviary just for the burst of colour, plus that stunning massive waterfall is incredible! If you love colourful birds, this enclosure is where you&#8217;ll see some of the world’s most brilliantly coloured birds amongst wetland vegetation and crimson blooms – from Scarlet and Red-and-green Macaws to Scarlet Ibises, Roseate Spoonbills and American Flamingos.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a 20m-tall waterfall inspired by the San Juan Curi waterfall in Colombia, as a tribute to the much-loved Waterfall Aviary of Jurong Bird Park.</p>
<p><strong>2. Bird Paradise: Nyungwe Forest Heart of Africa aviary</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_203842" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-203842" style="width: 753px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-203842" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bird-paradise-singapore-nyungwe-forest-heart-of-africa.jpeg" alt="bird paradise singapore - heart of africa aviary" width="753" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bird-paradise-singapore-nyungwe-forest-heart-of-africa.jpeg 753w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bird-paradise-singapore-nyungwe-forest-heart-of-africa-300x223.jpeg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bird-paradise-singapore-nyungwe-forest-heart-of-africa-100x74.jpeg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-203842" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Mandai Wildlife Group</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the largest aviary of Bird Paradise (1.55 hectares) with elevated canopies and suspension bridges overlooking forest streams. Here you&#8217;ll find 80 African bird species.</p>
<p>I loved catching sight of some of the African birds that I remembered from my childhood growing up in Kenya like grey parrots and Black-crowned Cranes. Watch out though – because at feeding time, the birds swoop down, and you may just get a White Superb Starling perching on your head!</p>
<p><strong>3. Bird Paradise: Kuok Group Wings of Asia aviary</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_203843" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-203843" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-203843" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bird-paradise-jurong-bird-park-aviary.jpg" alt="bird paradise jurong bird park aviary " width="720" height="559" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bird-paradise-jurong-bird-park-aviary.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bird-paradise-jurong-bird-park-aviary-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bird-paradise-jurong-bird-park-aviary-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-203843" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Beate Baldry</figcaption></figure>
<p>Huge Australian Pelicans, different types of beautiful Hornbills, Spoonbills, long-legged Storks and other birds of Asia can be found wading the rice paddy terraces – they also have the option of flying overhead in the large enclosure. The kids will love throwing the storks little fish, so make sure you look into the bird-feeding sessions (more below).</p>
<p><strong>4. Bird Paradise: Amazonian Jewels aviary</strong></p>

<p>This aviary is home to charming species like the Golden Parakeet, Andean Cock-of-the-Rock, Saffron Toucanet and Chestnut-eared Aracari plus doves and pigeons.</p>
<p><strong>5. Bird Paradise: Songs of the Forest aviary</strong></p>

<p>Singing songbirds of Asia live here – don&#8217;t miss the pretty Victoria Crowned Pigeon, plus other birds like the Bali Myna, Snow-white Bali mynahs and the Straw-headed Bulbul (and see if you can spot additional mammal species such as the Lesser Mousedeer).</p>
<p><strong>6. Bird Paradise: Lory Loft aviary</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_189058" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189058" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-189058 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bird-paradise-jurong-bird-park-3.jpg" alt=" Bird Paradise: Jurong Bird Park singapore Highlights, Ticket Promotions &amp; Playgrounds" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bird-paradise-jurong-bird-park-3.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bird-paradise-jurong-bird-park-3-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bird-paradise-jurong-bird-park-3-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-189058" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Beate Baldry</figcaption></figure>
<p>Reminiscent of our favourite spot the Lory Loft at Jurong Bird Park (the old bird park in Singapore), this new aviary at Bird Paradise is filled with colourful cute lories and parrots. These little guys are not shy, so you can get up close and watch them water bathe and feed – get your camera ready! If you opt for feeding them with the special food cups, you may get a Lory perching on your wrist!</p>
<p><strong>7. Bird Paradise: Mysterious Papua aviary</strong></p>

<p>This is home to the second largest living bird in the world – the Emu. Look out for the Laughing Kookaburra (you may hear it before you see it!) and keep your eyes peeled for the master of disguise, the Tawny Frogmouth, as it camouflages as a tree branch (we were so delighted to catch a sight of it! There&#8217;s also rumoured to be Red-necked Wallabies in this aviary.</p>

<p>Bird shows/presentations at Bird Paradise happen twice daily at the Sky Amphitheatre, plus there&#8217;s a new digital screen that was not previously available at Jurong Bird Park. This huge space has been designed for raptors like the White-bellied Sea Eagle to make longer flights, while other species can take off from higher platforms to showcase flights from heights that were not previously possible at Jurong Bird Park.</p>
<p>Each bird show lasts for 15 to 20 minutes. See the bird trainers in action, and learn about these awesome birds. <em>Pssst!</em> Prep the kiddos to be ready to volunteer if they are up for it – the bird trainers often ask little ones to get on stage to help, and it&#8217;s quite a fun experience!</p>

<h2>Kids&#8217; playgrounds at Bird Paradise</h2>
<p>There are a few playgrounds for kids within Bird Paradise that you can access only with a Bird Paradise entry ticket. The first playground that you&#8217;ll come to is right next to Starbucks before the entrance of Bird Paradise (so it&#8217;s technically part of Mandai West, and as such is free to enter as it&#8217;s before the ticketing area of Bird Paradise).</p>
<p>Within Bird Paradise bird park, the main play areas are a dry playground called Treetops Play and a water play area called Egg Splash.</p>

<ul>
<li>The aviaries are not covered, so bring hats and wear sunscreen.</li>
<li>It gets hot, so we really enjoyed the many hubs between each aviary. These indoor educational spaces have air-con, which provides some relief from the heat and also offers kids loads of information on the birds, including lots of fun hands-on interactive elements.</li>
<li>Bird Paradise has lots of covered walkways and is largely stroller-friendly, but there are also kids&#8217; carts, wagons and trikes to rent if you have kids who aren&#8217;t big on walking.</li>
<li>Bring swimmers for the <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-free-water-play-parks/">water play</a> inside Bird Paradise.</li>

<p>Kindness Garden is a sensory-filled installation by Japanese artist Hiromi Tango that encourages children to explore empathy through sight, sound, touch, and smell. Surrounded by oversized flowers, kids can discover messages of kindness written in braille, offering a glimpse into how the visually impaired experience the world. At the heart of the garden is a “sound flower” that invites playful interaction through sound and movement. Designed with inclusivity in mind, the installation also features calm domes filled with lavender-scented plushies, creating a quiet, soothing space especially thoughtful for neurodivergent children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Bathtime is more than just hygiene. Parenting coach Swetha Vigraham explains when parents can let go of the reins and how it teaches important lessons in independence, body respect, and personal boundaries.</h2>
<p>When my son was born, I received three baby rockers as gifts from friends. Like many new parents, I learned the importance of better communication to avoid duplicates. But since I had three, I made the best of them: one as a dining chair, another as a naptime bed, and the last—most unusually—as a bathing buddy.<br />
Yes, one of the rockers found its home next to the glass shower partition. My son, like many babies, had an uncanny ability to sense when I was showering. Even if he was napping, the sound of water would wake him, and he&#8217;d cry inconsolably until he could see me through the glass. This began our unique bathing adventures.</p>
<p>As my workload increased, so did my son&#8217;s hours in childcare. To compensate for missing playtime, I created two sacred routines: his bath time and bedtime. These moments became our special bonding rituals, filled with giggles, bubbles, and heartwarming questions.</p>
<p>Until one day, as he threw a curious question about my body, I realised it was time to respect both our privacies. It was time for him to start bathing independently.</p>

<h2>How do you know your child is ready?</h2>

<p><strong>Ability:</strong> Does your child have the physical coordination to stand steadily in the shower and handle the showerhead?<br />
<strong>Capability:</strong> Can they understand bathroom safety? For example, mixing hot and cold water safely and avoiding water play near electrical appliances.<br />
<strong>Curiosity:</strong> Are they asking questions about their bodies and showing signs of self-awareness?<br />
<strong>Confidence:</strong> Are they expressing the desire to bathe themselves, perhaps starting with soaping or rinsing?</p>
<p>While I worried whether my son could clean his back properly or dry himself thoroughly, I knew I had to support this milestone while treasuring the memories we had built.</p>
<h2>Why is bath time more than just hygiene?</h2>
<p>For toddlers, bath time is about splashing and playing. For older children, it transforms into an important lesson in independence, body respect, and personal boundaries. These are crucial for their self-esteem and body positivity, especially as they approach puberty.</p>
<p>With my son, we took it step by step—starting with washing his legs and stomach, then moving to his face and tricky back. By age six, he was confidently managing his bath time, and I felt a mix of pride and bittersweet nostalgia.</p>

<h2>How can parents navigate this transition?</h2>
<figure id="attachment_231007" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-231007" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-231007" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kids-bath-time-3.jpg" alt="Kids Bath Time - When Should Kids Bathe Independently?" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kids-bath-time-3.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kids-bath-time-3-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kids-bath-time-3-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-231007" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Mateus Andre via Freepik</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Take Small Steps:</strong> Introduce independent tasks early, like soaping their body (ages 3 to 5), washing their body but not hair (ages 6 to 8), and gradually building up to full independence by age 9-12.<br />
<strong>Have Conversations:</strong> Respect their readiness. If they express interest, encourage them. If not, gently ask how they feel about starting.<br />
<strong>Provide Support:</strong> Equip them with age-appropriate tools like anti-slip mats, light towels, and visual checklists to remind them of the steps.<br />
<strong>Be Nearby:</strong> Stay close enough to assist if needed, especially during the early stages.</p>
<p>Cultural differences and individual preferences play a role in this transition. Remember to adapt based on your child’s personality and developmental pace.</p>
<h2>Bathing is a milestone in the Parent-Child Journey.</h2>
<p>I will always cherish the splashes and giggles of bath time. But as my son grows, our bonding moments have shifted. Now, we enjoy long walks, cosy reading sessions, or lazy afternoons at the pool.</p>
<p>Letting go of caregiving responsibilities can be bittersweet, but it’s also an act of love. So, the next time your child says, “I can do it myself,” take a deep breath and let them try. You’re not just teaching them independence; you’re strengthening your bond in new ways.</p>

<h2><strong>A Voyage Back in Time: Level 1 at Children&#8217;s Museum Singapore</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-182027 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singapore-marketplace-fruits.jpg" alt="children's museum singapore marketplace fruit stall" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singapore-marketplace-fruits.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singapore-marketplace-fruits-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singapore-marketplace-fruits-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>Little ones can embark on a time-travelling voyage with Captain and WonderBot to explore how Singapore came to be. Unlike most museums, kids are free to touch anything and everything within their reach. From picking up the fruits and vegetables to climbing into the barber&#8217;s chair, nothing is out of bounds.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-182032 aligncenter" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singaporeo-voyage-traveler.jpg" alt="children's museum singapore voyage traveller " width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singaporeo-voyage-traveler.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singaporeo-voyage-traveler-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singaporeo-voyage-traveler-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p><em>The Hidden Chamber</em>, an immersive show on a projector screen, is where Captain will open his secret stash of treasure and share stories about the origins of each object.</p>
<p>A highlight for kids will be the mini boat, crocodile (don&#8217;t feed him!) and the ship where kids can crouch down into the berths or tuck themselves into a hammock in the cabins! Along this time-travelling journey, the kids will get to experience sailing through stormy weather and eventually disembark at the port of Singapore to unleash their exploratory instincts at Ahoy Singapore!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-182030 aligncenter" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singapore-barber-marketplace.jpg" alt="children's museum singapore barber shop" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singapore-barber-marketplace.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singapore-barber-marketplace-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singapore-barber-marketplace-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>As you wander through the streets of old in Singapore at The Marketplace, your kids will get to explore the bustling shophouses, handle shop products, pump old-fashioned water pumps, learn about different spices, listen to stories of shopkeepers, and try heritage trades like acting as a street barber or traditional letter writer.</p>
<p>Little ones will be captivated by the colourful sights and busy sounds of the old Singapore streets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-182029 aligncenter" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singapore-stamps-post-office.jpg" alt="childrens museum singapore post office stamps" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singapore-stamps-post-office.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singapore-stamps-post-office-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/childrens-museum-singapore-stamps-post-office-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>The path will eventually lead you to the present day, where the kids can design their own stamps in the neighbourhood post office. They can even write a letter and deliver their message across the room through a message tunnel – watch their little faces light up with excitement as the message capsule zips through the tunnel!</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Now till 2027</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Looking for fun activities for teenagers in Singapore? From thrill-seeking activities to more chilled hang out spots, here are some ideas on things to do with teenagers in Singapore!</h2>
<p>One of the things we love about living in Singapore is how safe it is compared to other places meaning <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/parenting-teachings-kids-commute-solo-independence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kids can often commute solo</a> from a younger age than in other countries. With teenagers, we can afford them more freedom with independent outings than we would if we were living somewhere else. And in Singapore, there are plenty of activities for teenagers. From checking out <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-free-water-play-parks/">water parks,</a> <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-go-kart-singapore/">go-karting</a> and <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-best-kids-parks-in-singapore/">outdoor parks</a> to hanging out at the <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/family-life-coffices-best-work-friendly-free-wifi-cafes/">best cafes</a> selling amazing <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/the-best-ice-cream-and-frozen-yogurt-places-in-singapore-yummo/">ice cream and gelatos</a>. If you&#8217;re looking for some inspiration to keep your teens busy in Singapore, here&#8217;s our list of fun teen activities<strong> &#8211;</strong> <em>whether your teen chooses to go on these adventures with you or with their friends! </em>Obviously, you can’t be the one to suggest these ideas to your teens &#8211; that’d be way uncool. But hey, a subtle hint never hurt anyone. Maybe casually mention a weekend hangout? You know, just in case they’re suddenly interested in exploring <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-weekend-planner-fun-activities-events-kids/">fun things to do in Singapore during the weekend</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Best activities for teenagers in Singapore:</strong></p>
<h2>1. Make a splash at teen-approved water parks</h2>
<figure id="attachment_224112" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224112" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-224112 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/things-to-do-in-singapore-kids-activities-wild-wild-wet.jpg" alt="Things to do in Singapore - outdoor kids activities - Wild Wild Wet - teen activities - activities for teenagers" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/things-to-do-in-singapore-kids-activities-wild-wild-wet.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/things-to-do-in-singapore-kids-activities-wild-wild-wet-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/things-to-do-in-singapore-kids-activities-wild-wild-wet-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-224112" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Wild Wild Wet</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&#8217;re new here, you should know that <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-free-water-play-parks/">water parks</a> are a favourite with the Sassy Mama team. They&#8217;re perfect activities for all ages (yes, even parents!) and they&#8217;re the best places to be to escape Singapore&#8217;s tropical heat. <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/directory/wild-wild-wet/">Wild Wild Wet at Downtown East</a> is a longtime favourite, with rides that range from easy-going to seriously thrilling. It’s compact enough that you won’t lose sight of your tweens, but still packed with enough splashy action to keep your teens buzzing. Got a daredevil? Point them straight to the Torpedo &#8211; they’ll thank you for the adrenaline rush.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/directory/adventure-cove-waterpark/">Adventure Cove Waterpark</a> is another great water park in <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-sentosa-for-kids-guide-attractions-beach-staycation/">Sentosa</a> and a trip here can easily fill a whole day. Thrillseekers will love the Riptide Rocket or for something calmer visit the Rainbow Reef or the Adventure River. Splashworks is where to head for various challenges including climbing ropes, balancing beams and more!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Hari Raya Haji 2025 falls on 7 June 2025. Here&#8217;s all you need to know about the significance of Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji, and how they&#8217;re celebrated in Singapore.</h2>
<p>&#8220;Wait, it&#8217;s Hari Raya again? Didn&#8217;t we just celebrate it two months ago?&#8221; and &#8220;Why are there two Hari Raya celebrations in a year?&#8221; are probably common questions you&#8217;ll see every year. Hari Raya Puasa or Hari Raya Aidilfitri falls on 31 March 2025, and this festival celebrates the end of the <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/whats-on-ramadan-explain-holy-month-children/">month of Ramadan</a>, AKA the Islamic holy month of fasting. Not to be confused with Hari Raya Haji, which is referred to as the Festival of Sacrifice. Hari Raya Haji falls on 7 June 2025!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a lowdown of all you need to know about these two special days, and how it&#8217;s celebrated by Muslims in Singapore</p>
<h2>Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri</h2>
<figure id="attachment_223916" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223916" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-223916" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hari-raya-puasa-haji-aidilfitri-singapore-celebration.jpeg" alt="hari raya puasa hari raya haji hari raya aidillfitri singapore" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hari-raya-puasa-haji-aidilfitri-singapore-celebration.jpeg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hari-raya-puasa-haji-aidilfitri-singapore-celebration-300x233.jpeg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hari-raya-puasa-haji-aidilfitri-singapore-celebration-100x78.jpeg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-223916" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: MUIS via Instagram</figcaption></figure>
<p>Also known as Eid al-Fitr, Hari Raya Puasa marks the end of the <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/whats-on-ramadan-explain-holy-month-children/">Islamic month of Ramadan</a> and is one of the most important celebrations of the year. &#8220;Puasa&#8221; means fasting, and during Ramadan, Muslims around the world fast from dawn to sunset.</p>
<p>But fasting isn&#8217;t just about abstaining from food and drink (yes, even water!), it&#8217;s a spiritual practice that promotes self-discipline, empathy for the less fortunate, and a deeper connection with God.</p>
<p>There is no fixed date on the Gregorian calendar for both Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji. Like all Islamic festivals, the dates for Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji are based on astronomical calculations that rely on the sighting of the new moon.</p>
<p>Because of this Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji differ from year to year. In Singapore, the Islamic Religious Council (known in Malay as Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura, or MUIS) is responsible for determining the date of the festival each year.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Hari Raya Haji is relatively a quieter celebration in Singapore. Hari Raya Haji (which means “great day of the <em>haj</em>” in Malay), also known as Aidiladha (also spelt Eid al-Adha or Eid Adha) or the Great Day of Sacrifice, is a Muslim festival that falls on the 10th day of Zulhijjah (the 12th month in the Islamic calendar).</p>
<p>Hari Raya Haji also coincides with the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, a significant event for Muslims worldwide and also one of the Five Pillars of Islam.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the difference between Hari Raya Haji and Hari Raya Puasa?</h2>

<p>Hari Raya Puasa aka Eid-ul-Fitr was celebrated on 31 March 2025 and signified the end of the fasting month of <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/whats-on-ramadan-explain-holy-month-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ramadan</a>, while Hari Raya Haji (7 June 2025) is celebrated to mark the Muslim pilgrimage (hajj), and is a day when Muslims usually perform the annual &#8216;korban&#8217; ritual.</p>

<h2>Are Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji public holidays in Singapore?</h2>
<p>Yes, Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji are designated as <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-singapore-international-school-holidays-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public holidays in Singapore</a>.</p>
<h2>What is the &#8216;korban&#8217; ritual?</h2>
<p>Hari Raya Haji commemorates the willingness of the Islamic prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son Ismail in an act of obedience to God. The korban is one of the main rituals and involves the sacrificial slaughtering of livestock such as cows, sheep or goats.</p>
<p>The sacrifice ritual is done quickly (the jugular vein at the animal’s throat is slit quickly to ensure the quickest death possible), then the meat is cleaned and distributed to the community, the poor and needy.</p>
<h2>How is Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji celebrated in Singapore?</h2>
<figure id="attachment_223912" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223912" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-223912" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hari-raya-puasa-haji-aidilfitri-singapore-food.jpg" alt="hari raya puasa hari raya haji hari raya aidillfitri singapore" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hari-raya-puasa-haji-aidilfitri-singapore-food.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hari-raya-puasa-haji-aidilfitri-singapore-food-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hari-raya-puasa-haji-aidilfitri-singapore-food-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-223912" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Visit Singapore</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Hari Raya Puasa:</strong></p>
<p>In Singapore, Hari Raya Puasa is a vibrant celebration, with Muslim families donning their finest colourful ethnic costumes as they spend the day visiting loved ones. The festival emphasises unity, forgiveness, and the importance of family. The day kicks off with special prayers at the mosque, followed by a sermon.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also see <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/ramadan-bazaars-singapore/">Ramadan bazaars</a> popping up around Singapore during the month of Ramadan leading up to Hari Raya Puasa/Aidilfitri, including the biggest <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/eat-hari-raya-geylang-serai-ramadan-bazaar/">bazaar in Geylang Serai</a>. These bazaars will consist of delicious food, Hari Raya goodies, festive costumes, performances and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Hari Raya Haji:</strong></p>
<p>Besides the korban ritual on Hari Raya Haji, Muslims usually congregate to perform Hari Raya Haji prayers in the morning at the mosque and then visit close family members just like they do during Hari Raya Puasa. Muslims use it as an opportunity to gather and strengthen family bonds.</p>
<p>No Hari Raya celebration is complete without the delicious festive food! Expect a spread of festive dishes like ketupat (rice cakes), rendang (spicy meat stew), ayam masak merah (chicken in spicy tomato paste), and more. For sweet treats, every home you visit will be filled with a variety of goodies, with favourites like Makmur, Suji, and Kueh Tart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Beaches, luxurious resorts, spas and fab hospitality: Phuket makes a great family-friendly destination near Singapore. Read on for all the best things to do in Phuket with kids, where to stay, when to visit and more.</h2>
<p>Located just a two-hour flight from Singapore, Phuket is a convenient holiday destination that’s packed with family-friendly fun. Not only do we love the island’s beautiful beaches, islands and reefs, but we also love that it’s got some great kids’ activities (despite it also being known for adult-only “fun” at Patong). For families planning a Phuket itinerary, here are all the best things to do in Phuket with kids, including where to stay (Club Med Phuket is a win, for us!) and the best time to travel to Phuket.</p>

<h2><a name="visit"></a>Best time to visit Phuket</h2>
<p>The best time to visit Phuket is between November and April, during the dry season. During this time, Phuket experiences low rainfall and clear waters. The rainy season in Phuket starts in May and ends in October. During the monsoon season in Phuket, the island experiences lots of thunderstorms, so don’t expect to be doing many beach and water activities during this time..</p>
<p>Nevertheless, May and October are still considered great times to travel to Phuket as they’re off-peak with occasional showers. Meanwhile, peak travel season in Phuket is from December to February.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="flights"></a>Singapore to Phuket flights</h2>
<p>Flights between Singapore and Phuket take only about two hours, making it a convenient getaway for families from Singapore. Direct flights from Singapore to Phuket are available daily on Singapore Airlines, Scoot and Jetstar.</p>

<h3>Explore Phuket islands: Popular Phuket tourist attraction</h3>
<figure id="attachment_230768" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230768" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-230768" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/things-to-do-in-phuket-island-hopping-snorkelling-diving.jpg" alt="Things to do in Phuket with kids - phuket island hopping snorkelling diving" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/things-to-do-in-phuket-island-hopping-snorkelling-diving.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/things-to-do-in-phuket-island-hopping-snorkelling-diving-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/things-to-do-in-phuket-island-hopping-snorkelling-diving-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230768" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Pelago</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the best things to do in Phuket is island-hopping, especially with tour operators at nearly every corner of the island. That said, a visit to Phi Phi Islands is worth it for its backpacker vibes and calm, clear waters; Similan Islands for diving and snorkelling amidst colourful reefs; and Coral Island for its white sand beaches. Island-hopping can usually be done within a day (or even half a day, if you start early), and is great for admiring the island’s spectacular marine life. You can book a snorkelling tour in Phuket <a href="http://pelago.pxf.io/RGL7zX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Naka Weekend Night Market: Phuket Night Market</h3>
<figure id="attachment_230773" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230773" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-230773" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/things-to-do-in-phuket-kids-naka-weekend-night-market.jpg" alt="Things to do in phuket with kids - naka weekend night market" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/things-to-do-in-phuket-kids-naka-weekend-night-market.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/things-to-do-in-phuket-kids-naka-weekend-night-market-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/things-to-do-in-phuket-kids-naka-weekend-night-market-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230773" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Naka Weekend Night Market</figcaption></figure>
<p>Can you really say you’ve visited Phuket without spending an evening at a night market? Phuket night markets are a must for great shopping and street food, and you can start at the famous Naka Weekend Night Market. You’ll find live entertainment, cafes, cheap seafood and lots of souvenirs and beachwear–all suitable for families without the more “adult” elements of the markets at Patong Beach.</p>
<p>Of course, finding a night market in Phuket is easy as they’re pretty much everywhere! Other night markets to visit: Phuket Old Town Sunday Night Market and Kata Night Market.</p>

<h3>Visit a Phuket elephant sanctuary: Things to do in Phuket with kids</h3>
<figure id="attachment_230772" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230772" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-230772" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/things-to-do-in-phuket-kids-elephant-sanctuary-phuket.jpg" alt="Things to do in Phuket with kids - elephant sanctuary phuket" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/things-to-do-in-phuket-kids-elephant-sanctuary-phuket.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/things-to-do-in-phuket-kids-elephant-sanctuary-phuket-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/things-to-do-in-phuket-kids-elephant-sanctuary-phuket-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230772" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Phuket Elephant Sanctuary</figcaption></figure>
<p>Wondering what to do in Phuket with kids? Bring the little ones to see majestic elephants in their natural habitat at the Phuket Elephant Sanctuary in the Thalang District. This 30-acre park is home to rescued elephants who’ve spent their lives in captivity–that means no unethical practices such as elephant shows and riding. Instead, visitors can observe them from a 500-metre-long Canopy Walkway (Thailand&#8217;s largest!), take guided tours or volunteer to help out at the sanctuary.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to find plenty more Phuket elephant sanctuaries around the island. However, we highly recommend doing some research and reading reviews before choosing one to visit to ensure they practice ethical treatment of the elephants.</p>

<h3>Carnival Magic Phuket &amp; Phuket FantaSea: Fun things to do in Phuket</h3>

<p>Dazzling lights, vibrant colours and over-the-top theatrics quite aptly describe the cultural theme parks of Phuket, Carnival Magic Phuket and Phuket FantaSea. Considered one of the most entertaining things to do in Phuket, these cultural parks provide next-level entertainment for families: think parades, acrobatics, funfairs and large-scale cultural performances.</p>
<p>Carnival Magic Phuket is said to be the more family-friendly of the two; Phuket FantaSea is also thoroughly entertaining, however, it’s good to note that Phuket FantaSea features live animals, which sparks some concerns regarding the ethical treatment of animals.</p>

<p>Andamanda Phuket is a water park in Phuket that embodies the theme of Thai culture and myths. Tucked between traditional Thai architecture are thrilling water slides (there’s a good variety of them, too!), lazy rivers, wave pools and lots of entertainment. Just take note that the park is a rather popular Phuket attraction. You can expect crowds during the weekends and during the holiday season, so be prepared for longer wait times on the more popular slides.</p>

<p>If you need a place to hide from the scorching sun or rain, Central Festival Phuket is your best bet. This shopping mall in Phuket has plenty of modern retail stores, designer brands, and restaurants, which is fantastic if you want to shop in air-conditioned comfort. It’s also home to Aquaria Phuket, Thailand’s largest aquarium and Phuket’s very own Trick Eye Museum.</p>

<h3>Phuket Old Town: Lesser-known things to do in Phuket</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113002" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/old-phuket-town2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="504" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/old-phuket-town2.jpg 700w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/old-phuket-town2-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/old-phuket-town2-100x72.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>When it comes to things to do in Phuket, it’s obvious that the beach life is the highlight of this island destination. But if you’ve got little explorers with you, then Phuket Old Town is worth a visit. Phuket Old Town has a myriad of Sino-Portuguese buildings and street art, shrines and markets. If you’re on a shorter Phuket itinerary, then a day trip to Phuket Old Town would be adequate to see the key Phuket attractions. Still, avid travellers recommend spending at least two days here to really experience the local culture.</p>

<p>Phuket has plenty of beaches and tonnes of great resorts. If you’re having trouble deciding which area is best for you, then here’s a brief rundown of some of the most popular beaches in Phuket:</p>
<p><strong>Patong Beach:</strong> Arguably the most popular and touristy area of Phuket, known for its adult entertainment and vibrant party scene. This area is more suitable for adults looking to have fun.</p>
<p><strong>Karon Beach and Kata Beach:</strong> These beaches, located south of Patong Beach, are also popular tourist destinations in Phuket, but are known for their more laid-back atmosphere. Karon Beach is a long stretch of white sand beach, while Kata Beach is known for surfing and watersports.</p>
<p><strong>Kamala Beach, Surin Beach, Nai Harn Beach:</strong> These are some of the most secluded beaches in Phuket. Great for families looking for a quiet getaway.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Bangla Road Phuket: Things to do in Phuket for adults</h3>
<p>Need a break from the kiddos? Bangla Road is where you can experience the epitome of Phuket’s vibrant nightlife. This area is lined with bars adorned with neon lights and dancers, blasting loud music. You’ll also find street performers, artists and street-side stalls selling souvenirs and snacks. Bangla Road Phuket is the area where you’ll find lots of the adult entertainment Phuket is so well-known for, so it’s definitely not recommended for kids.</p>

<p>Beach? Check. Kids club? Check. Kid-friendly food? Check! At Club Med Phuket, you’re pretty much guaranteed a fuss-free stay with the kiddos with its all-inclusive concept. And now with Club Med Phuket’s all-new Family Oasis, you’ll find it hard to peel yourself away from this family-friendly resort in Phuket. The Family Oasis is a brand new space that includes all-new family rooms and the Splash Park, a mini water park with plenty of water jets, winding water slides and cabanas (including kid-sized ones!) that’s pretty much a sunny utopia for young ones.</p>
<p>Pair all this with Club Med Phuket’s family-friendly offerings, and you’ve got a holiday the kids will remember for years to come. The kids’ club here isn’t just confined to the physical kids’ club building. Throughout the day you’ll see the various groups of kids, from preschoolers to teens, taking part in a myriad of activities. Kids can try their hand at circus school (fancy, a flying trapeze class, anyone?), take part in workshops, have pool and foam parties, and more. After dinner, catch an entertaining nightly show–mostly performed by Club Med Phuket’s friendly and energetic staff members–followed by parties for the grown-ups.</p>
<p>With the kids occupied at the kids’ club, Mum and Dad can also get some alone time. We love that there’s an adult-only Zen Pool and an on-site spa for winding down. Not to mention, plenty of wellness and sports activities, including Thai Boxing, snorkelling and more–all included in your stay!</p>

<p><a name="method"></a></p>
<h2>What is the Montessori Method?</h2>
<p>With schools around the world and a slew of famous alumni, the Montessori method has a reputation for encouraging curiosity and “outside the box” thinking in children. It’s a child-centred educational approach developed over 100 years ago by Maria Montessori – Italy’s first female doctor. According to The American Montessori Society, the Montessori method &#8220;is a view of the child as one who is naturally eager for knowledge and capable of initiating learning in a supportive, thoughtfully prepared learning environment. It is an approach that values the human spirit and the development of the whole child – physical, social, emotional and cognitive.”</p>
<p>In short, kids are sponges, and given the freedom to explore and learn at their own pace, their minds will flourish. A “true” Montessori school possesses the following core traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixed-age classrooms that facilitate peer learning (younger kids learn from older kids, and the older kids reinforce their own learning by teaching the younger kids)</li>
<li>Uninterrupted blocks of work time (typically in three-hour intervals)</li>
<li>Children can choose their own activities (with guidance and encouragement from teachers)</li>
<li>Specially designed learning materials that aren&#8217;t toys</li>
<li>A deliberately arranged classroom environment (nary a desk in sight!)</li>
<li>Teachers trained at <a href="https://montessori-ami.org/training-programmes/training-centres" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official</a> Montessori training centres certified by Association Montessori Internationale (AMI)</li>
<li>No grades or tests</li>
<li>Focus on four key areas: Practical life, Sensorial, Language and Mathematics</li>
</ul>
<p>With children in many ways left to their own devices, Montessori is thought to foster independence, leadership skills and self-control. A 2006 study by Science Magazine found that by the end of kindergarten, Montessori children “performed better on standardised tests of reading and math, engaged in more positive interaction on the playground, and showed more advanced social cognition and executive control. They also showed more concern for fairness and justice.”</p>

<h2>How Montessori Education Works in Singapore</h2>
<figure id="attachment_177217" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177217" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-177217" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Montessori-preschools-singapore.jpg" alt="Montessori preschools singapore" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Montessori-preschools-singapore.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Montessori-preschools-singapore-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Montessori-preschools-singapore-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-177217" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Getty Images</figcaption></figure>
<p>Because Montessori is more of a philosophy than a rigid curriculum, any school can call itself Montessori, even if it barely adheres to the core principles. They would certainly seem to be at odds with Singapore, where testing, grades and a strict classroom environment play a huge role in the educational system (and rules and parameters tend to guide daily life in general!). Parents who fret about how their child will perform in P1 are understandably nervous about a system without grades or testing – <em>how can I ensure my child is on the right track?</em></p>
<p>All that said, there are many satisfied parents out there who feel Montessori instilled critical thinking skills and independence in their kids as well as a strong foundation in reading, writing and math. Some children might struggle to adapt to the rigidity of desks and homework after being at a Montessori school at first, but kids are highly adaptable, and often, the strong foundation and educational curiosity seem to win out. Make sure to reach out to any school you’re investigating to speak with current and former parents. Montessori schools in Singapore typically encourage parents and prospective parents to observe classrooms to get a feel for the programme and how it might work for their child.</p>

<h2>Montessori Preschools &amp; Kindergartens in Singapore</h2>
<p>While we&#8217;ve listed out some of the most established Montessori preschools in Singapore, our list is hardly exhaustive and is certainly <em>not</em> an official list of endorsed schools. As you’ll see, hardly any Singapore Montessori schools meet <em>all</em> of the core Montessori criteria listed above. The tradeoff is that many Montessori schools have created an environment thought to help kids more easily transition into Singapore’s traditional educational system – many have fantastic Mandarin immersion programmes, while still incorporating the flexible style and unique materials of the Montessori method. When you are looking for a Montessori school you can ask if they adhere to the Montessori school core traits listed above to see for yourself which schools best suit what you are looking for.</p>

<p>MMI is in no way affiliated with AMI, though they do have a training centre in Singapore, so many teachers are trained there. There are more than 20 MMI preschools across the island incorporating traditional Montessori materials and adhering to the four core values of practical life, sensorial, language and mathematics, but the consensus seems to be that it’s very different from a traditional Montessori environment. Classes are not mixed-age.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Macbeth on Roblox is a new Roblox game where students can explore and learn about the fascinating world of one of William Shakespeare’s most famous tragedies through the eyes of the brave Scottish general Macbeth.</h2>
<p>Roblox is all the rage these days, but the good news is that parents now have a way to inject some educational benefits via the game. <a href="https://www.roblox.com/join/0bi6f">Macbeth on Roblox</a> is the latest brainchild of Singapore Repertory Theatre (SRT), newly launched on 7 May 2025. As its title suggests, it&#8217;s an immersive game that brings one of William Shakespeare&#8217;s most famous plays, Macbeth, to life! Just think of it as a digital extension of SRT&#8217;s ever-popular <a href="https://www.srt.com.sg/show/macbeth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shakespeare in the Park – Macbeth</a>, which also returns to the Fort Canning stage on the same day!</p>
<p>In the game, players can step into Macbeth’s world and experience his story firsthand. Yes, battles and all! Here&#8217;s what to expect:</p>
<h2>Students can explore the classic tale through a platform they love</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-230157" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/macbeth-on-roblox-srt-singapore-repertory-theatre-2.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/macbeth-on-roblox-srt-singapore-repertory-theatre-2.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/macbeth-on-roblox-srt-singapore-repertory-theatre-2-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/macbeth-on-roblox-srt-singapore-repertory-theatre-2-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>In case you don&#8217;t already know, Macbeth tells the tale of a brave Scottish general who was tempted by power after being told by three witches that he would one day become king. Because of his greed, he&#8217;s willing to stop at nothing to sit on the throne, including murdering the current king! However, once he becomes king, Macbeth becomes paranoid and violent and loses his sense of right and wrong, and more people suffer as a result. Definitely an important learning point that true greatness comes from integrity and not ambition alone.</p>
<p>In this immersive Roblox game, players can roleplay as Macbeth himself and explore some of the most dramatic moments in the play. It’s a stylised, sci-fi version of the story, where players get to make key decisions and face the consequences of Macbeth’s ambition. Whether your kid is a fan of Roblox or not, this unique game is the perfect way to introduce them to the well-loved classic tale. The game also has exciting content updates lined up, including new scenes that will be added over time.</p>
<h2>A unique way to introduce the teens to Shakespeare</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-230158" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/macbeth-on-roblox-srt-singapore-repertory-theatre-3.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/macbeth-on-roblox-srt-singapore-repertory-theatre-3.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/macbeth-on-roblox-srt-singapore-repertory-theatre-3-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/macbeth-on-roblox-srt-singapore-repertory-theatre-3-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>Macbeth on Roblox was developed with the National Arts Council, where it can also be used as an educational tool and a useful classroom resource. The game is designed to support MOE’s Literature in English curriculum and helps students better understand and appreciate the story of Macbeth in a way that feels fresh and relatable. This is especially useful for students who are studying the play for Literature lessons!</p>
<p>If you’re planning to catch <a href="https://www.srt.com.sg/show/macbeth/">Shakespeare in the Park – Macbeth at Fort Canning</a> (which we highly recommend!), and bringing your super-digital, knows-nothing-about-Shakespeare kids along, <a href="https://www.roblox.com/join/0bi6f">Macbeth on Roblox</a> is the perfect way to get them curious and excited. It’s a fun, hands-on way to explore the story before seeing it live. Plus, it’s educational, so that screen time? Totally worth it!</p>

<h2>Join fun workshops, farm tours &amp; more</h2>
<p>Brought to you by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and its partners, Go Green SG is a nationwide movement that’s all about inspiring families to go green.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>If you have a daughter who loves singing, dancing and performing, here&#8217;s your sign to check out the International Girls Choir open houses for a FREE trial class. Plus, read on to find out how to score a scholarship to join their Performing Choir.</h2>
<p data-start="130" data-end="655">If you have a daughter who can&#8217;t resist singing, dancing and putting on skits at home, the International Girls Choir (IGC) from the <a href="https://ispa.com.sg/join-igc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International School of Performing Arts</a> might be the place where she can truly shine! Open to girls aged 5 to 15, the IGC is where little ladies can develop their confidence and skills while having fun at the same time. Plus, no performing arts experience is required! Read on to find out more about how girls can find their voices (and dance moves!) with the IGC, and how to join a free trial class:</p>
<h2 data-start="657" data-end="1392">Girls get their talent, confidence &amp; resilience nurtured</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-230292 aligncenter" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sassy-3.jpg" alt="International School of Performing Arts - International Girls Choir" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sassy-3.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sassy-3-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sassy-3-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p data-start="657" data-end="1392">At the International Girls Choir, every girl has the opportunity to discover her voice. With a training model developed from the highly successful Australian Girls Choir, which has over 40 years of experience, the International Girls Choir offers a supportive, all-girls environment that nurtures talent and self-belief. This year, the International Girls Choir is also launching its Performing Choir–an audition-based group for girls who are ready for more challenging music and high-profile performances across Singapore.</p>
<p data-start="657" data-end="1392">Beyond helping girls find their voice and take their talent to the next level, parents testify to how the International Girls Choir helps their daughters grow in confidence, resilience and emotional well-being. Girls gain public speaking and presentation skills, learn teamwork and build friendships that boost their sense of belonging.</p>
<p data-start="657" data-end="1392">The International Girls Choir offers experiences that will shape your daughter&#8217;s character and gift her with memories of a lifetime. Just this year, 15 members from the Singapore choir will travel to Sydney to perform with their Australian Girls Choir sisters at the Sydney Opera House.</p>
<h2 data-start="1996" data-end="2613">Free open house events in May &amp; June</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>On the hunt for the best sushi in Singapore? From affordable value-for-money bento platters to conveyor belt sushi and gourmet sashimi, we round up the best Japanese restaurants for a casual family meal in 2025.</h2>
<p>Wondering where to get the best sushi in Singapore to satisfy that craving? There&#8217;s nothing like a beautiful platter of sushi and sashimi, whether you are dining out or ordering sushi delivery. The best part is &#8230; kids love it, it&#8217;s not fried, and it&#8217;s filled with Omega-3 goodness – so, everybody wins. Some sushi restaurants offer huge sushi platters for delivery, which are great for <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-kids-birthday-party-singapore-venues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">birthday parties</a>, <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/eat-best-picnic-singapore-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picnics</a>, or family dinners. Restaurants like Sushiro with conveyor belt sushi are always super popular with the kids (especially when that avocado maki is delivered on a sushi train!). As always, what constitutes the best sushi is subjective, so here we are highlighting what we reckon is the best sushi in Singapore for families. If you&#8217;re dining out with kids who love conveyor belt sushi, skip to the <a href="#conveyor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conveyor sushi section below</a>. While we&#8217;d love to splurge on omakase with Edo-style sushi, instead, we round up our favourite affordable casual Japanese restaurants where the fam can indulge in some of the tastiest bentos, tempura, sashimi, and sushi in Singapore!</p>

<p>Offering premium quality Japanese sushi and seafood at reasonable prices, Ganko Sushi is a Japanese restaurant that has high-quality seafood in a smart, bright restaurant (it&#8217;s refreshing to enjoy premium sushi in a non-hotel setting). Ganko Sushi has a new 15-course sushi omakase experience, where you can feast according to the season. The Japanese head chef at Ganko Sushi personally places orders with professional buyers at the Osaka Fish Market so there&#8217;s always fresh seafood flown in three times a week. Priced at an accessible $110 per person, Ganko Sushi’s new 15-course sushi omakase includes a starter, sashimi, multiple sushi offerings prepared individually according to the season, and a dessert. Definitely one we recommend if you are looking for premium sushi in Singapore!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>RIMBA by AYANA introduces the new RIMBA Jungle Adventure, a massive playground spanning over 17,000sqft. With access to all of AYANA Bali’s resort facilities and stunning cliffside views, here’s why you should plan your next family vacay here.</h2>
<p>Holidaying with the kids always brings about two big questions: What’s fun for the kids? And how do the adults get to squeeze in their own fun? Well, we can attest that you can check both boxes off at <a href="https://www.ayana.com/bali/offers/the-perfect-family-getaway/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medi%20um=sassymama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AYANA Bali</a>. Tucked away on a cliff overlooking Jimbaran Bay, AYANA Bali comprises a cluster of four award-winning luxury resorts. Stay at any of these resorts and you’ll get access to the facilities of all four resorts, which is why you’ll never run out of things to do here.</p>
<p>Now, the resort introduces its latest addition: the massive <a href="https://www.ayana.com/bali/experiences/rimba-kids-club/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=sassymama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RIMBA Jungle Adventure</a> at RIMBA by AYANA, with a playground that spans over 17,000sqft. With rates from $226/night*, here’s why this resort makes a failproof getaway for the family:</p>
<p><em>*Rate based on the lowest nightly rate during the summer 2025 season at the time of writing.</em></p>
<h2>New indoor &amp; outdoor playgrounds for young explorers</h2>

<p>It’s always a win when a resort has a playground. Now, make it very, very large and filled with exploration, and you’ll be left with happy kiddos who’ll remember this holiday for years to come. That said, the newly-launched RIMBA Jungle Adventure has everything you can imagine to delight kids of all ages: an outdoor playground with a web of climbing structures, slides, zip lines and more; and an indoor section with a ball pit and even more slides–all packed with adventure, learning and imaginative play.</p>

<p>What we love about AYANA Bali is that no matter which resort you’re staying at, you’ll get access to almost all the facilities of the other AYANA Bali resorts. And trust us, it’s worth exploring. Guests get access to 14 swimming pools, including an infinity pool, a river pool, kids&#8217; pools, cabanas and more. There’s also the secluded Kubu Beach located on a quiet cove with amazing views of the cliffs along the coastline. All-access also means you get to peruse both kids’ playgrounds at AYANA Resort Bali and RIMBA by AYANA. Families can also participate in fun workshops such as crafts and cooking, local experiences such as farm tours, and nature walks around the resort grounds.</p>
<p>There’s plenty for Mum and Dad, too! An array of wellness and fitness activities, including yoga, sound baths and 24/7 fitness centres, are at your disposal. Pamper yourself at one of the three spas: one on a cliff, another overlooking the sea, and one right by the shore, with rejuvenating facilities such as a Thalassotherapy pool. When tummies are rumbling, head to one of the 30 restaurants across the four resorts. You can find just about every cuisine you could crave, from fresh seafood to Italian, steak, Japanese and more, with kid-friendly options. Guests also get access to the iconic Rock Bar, situated atop the rocky shore, boasting arguably the best sunset views in Bali.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>“When I broke the news to my daughter that our helper was leaving, she was silent and stared off into space, refusing to look at me or let me touch her. My little 4-year-old couldn’t process that her ‘best friend’ Aunty Min would likely never return.”</h2>
<p>“Mama,” my 4-year-old daughter Lana called me, as she came into my room. “Aunty Min is crying,” she said about my helper, Min.</p>
<p>A million thoughts ran through my head: Was it heartbreak? Did something happen to a family member? Could she be … pregnant? It’s okay, I thought. We’ve gotten through her appendicitis, getting cheated on by her boyfriend, losing her grandmother, and more in the past. We surely can get through this, right?</p>
<p>“Ma’am,” Min approached me, trembling, when I came out of the room. She reached out and held my hand, and my heart dropped. I held my breath. “Ma’am. I’m so sorry, Ma’am. I need to go back to Myanmar … for my family,” she said, tears streaming down her face. I said, “It’s okay, Min&#8230;” “Ma’am, you and Sir have been so good to me, I’m so sorry,” she broke down sobbing and pulled me into a hug.</p>
<p>I knew at that moment there was little chance we could convince her to stay. My helper of three years was really leaving, even though she was happy with us. And although it had only been a relatively short time, Min was part of our family and shared a special bond with my daughter Lana. Here’s our story with our unexpected angel, who saved our family from falling apart when we were at our most vulnerable.</p>

<h2>We initially didn’t want a helper</h2>
<figure id="attachment_230392" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230392" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-230392" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/domestic-helper-leaving-4.jpg" alt="Domestic Helper leaving" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/domestic-helper-leaving-4.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/domestic-helper-leaving-4-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/domestic-helper-leaving-4-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230392" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Freepik</figcaption></figure>
<p>Min was the first and only helper we interviewed. We had zero experience with having a <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/best-maid-agencies-singapore-hire-helper/">helper in Singapore</a>, but we were desperate at that time. Min spoke little to no English, but we ended up hiring her off “good vibes”.</p>
<p>We had initially been reluctant to hire a helper. Plenty of people around me seemed to be able to do without (with multiple kids, mind you!), and we didn’t feel comfortable with having a “stranger” living in our home. I was also nervous about how Lana would adapt, seeing that she was extremely clingy with me. But with my husband’s airline pilot roster and my severe lack of a “village” in Singapore, we were struggling to hold everything together.</p>
<p>Lana was a very spritely 1.5-year-old, and I was working full-time. Yes, we sent her to a <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-childcare-centres-singapore/">childcare centre</a> during the day, but on the days she fell sick and stayed home, it was impossible for me to get any work or chores done. With my husband often away–or recuperating from flights–my life was 24/7 childcare, work and chores. My social life and my me-time became nonexistent.</p>
<p>I won’t go into the details, but the complete loss of identity and stress of managing everything on my own eventually began to eat away at my mental health. Not to mention, spiralling into petty arguments with my husband. After nights of breaking down and many, many talks about how we were going to improve our situation, we finally gave in and started looking for a helper to take some of the load off my shoulders.</p>

<h2>How my helper became my “co-parent”</h2>
<figure id="attachment_230393" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230393" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-230393" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/domestic-helper-leaving-5.jpg" alt="Domestic Helper leaving" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/domestic-helper-leaving-5.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/domestic-helper-leaving-5-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/domestic-helper-leaving-5-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230393" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: freepic.diller via Freepik</figcaption></figure>
<p>Min naturally seemed nervous when she arrived. I showed her around the house, gave her a rundown of her duties, and showed her what needed to be done. She pretty much got to work right away.</p>
<p>Then, in the evening when Lana came home from childcare, Min’s eyes lit up. Lana was often shy around strangers, but Min approached her and started playing with her, singing nursery rhymes and letting Lana show her her toys. Lana warmed up quickly.</p>
<p>It turned out we were going to be okay.</p>
<p>Lana and Min bonded and got along like a house on fire. Eventually, Min was able to step in when I needed help with mealtimes, bath time and bedtime. After over a year and a half of never having gone out without Lana or spending all my free time cleaning, I was able to regain some freedom. I was able to meet friends for dinner, go on date nights with my husband, or simply have an extra pair of hands to mind Lana when I was tied up or overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Min was always delighted to spend time with Lana, treating her as if she were her own. In fact, she was rather overprotective of Lana, always keeping a close eye on her safety when she was playing or climbing around. There were times I even felt a little envious of their relationship–Lana often preferred for Min to carry her, feed her, bathe her and play with her. They had their own inside jokes and conversations filled with huge laughter. Some may say I didn’t set boundaries, but Min and Lana would say “I love you” to each other in Burmese. She even taught Lana how to count and say other basic phrases in Burmese.</p>
<p>I quickly brushed that feeling of envy off, as I knew I’d always be Lana’s Mummy and that I was extremely lucky to have a helper who genuinely cared for my child. With Min now sharing my parenting load, it very much felt like she was my co-parent.</p>
<p>Of course, Min and I still had that employee-employer boundary, but we cared for each other. Whenever I was sick, Min would make sure to ask if I needed anything and then spring into action to mind Lana so I could rest. Likewise, we always ensured that Min knew she had us for support: we talked through her heartbreak, family problems and more. We always got each other gifts during special occasions and included her in all of our family celebrations, and she would bring back her favourite Burmese desserts for us when she went back to visit her family.</p>
<p>My husband and I would also often chat with her about her life and her family back home. Min is not married and has no kids, and is extremely close with her mum and siblings. She had even set up a small business back home to support her siblings and niece. It was obvious that Min was the rock of her family and that everything she does is <em>for</em> them.</p>
<h2>Saying goodbye to our unexpected angel</h2>
<figure id="attachment_230390" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230390" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-230390" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/domestic-helper-leaving-2.jpg" alt="Domestic Helper leaving" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/domestic-helper-leaving-2.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/domestic-helper-leaving-2-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/domestic-helper-leaving-2-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230390" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: jcomp via Freepik</figcaption></figure>
<p>Min was delighted to renew her contract after two years, and we always hoped that she would stay with us long-term. But that wasn’t in the cards for us. Min’s family was experiencing some hardships back in Myanmar, and they needed her to be with them. We knew that she wouldn’t be able to continue working in Singapore with such a weight on her shoulders. Family always comes first, we say, and so we supported her decision to leave.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect myself to feel so devastated when the reality of her leaving hit me.</p>
<p>When I broke the news to Lana that Min was leaving, Lana was silent and stared off into space, refusing to look at me or let me touch her. My little 4-year-old couldn’t process that her “best friend” would likely never return. I explained to Lana that her Aunty Min had to go home to her family, and that we’ll always be thankful for having had her around these past three years. Lana then went to Min’s room to give her a hug, before breaking down and crying inconsolably. “We still have time,” I told Lana, “Let’s just enjoy the last couple of months we have with Aunty Min, okay?”</p>
<p>Lana cried herself to sleep in my arms that night. The next day, she seemed to be back to normal, and so we carried on with our lives, periodically reminding Lana that her Aunty Min was leaving soon and that we’d have a new Aunty around. Lana seems to have accepted that Min is leaving, and we’re prepared for an <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/parenting-helper-kids-building-trust/">adjustment period once our new helper arrives</a>.</p>
<p>Min is leaving in a few days’ time, and there’s an obvious skip in her step. There’s also a heaviness in her–she’s happy that she will finally get to be with her family, but she’s also dreading the day she has to part ways with Lana. Due to the current situation in Myanmar, as well as Min’s family situation, it is unlikely that Min will ever return to work in Singapore.</p>
<p>As for my husband and me, we will always appreciate how Min became such an unexpected but amazing part of our little family. I don’t know if she realises just how much she did for us, but I made sure to let her know how grateful we were. We will always appreciate how, back in Myanmar, there’ll be a hardworking 30-year-old Min who has a heart of pure gold, is exceptionally resourceful and smart, who always puts others before herself, and who helped us get through one of our most vulnerable times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>She built the largest indoor playground in Singapore, and then 10 more across four countries. We chat with Heidi Tian, the founder and CEO of Kiztopia, about motherhood and what it’s like seeing her childhood vision of play come to life.</h2>
<p>Before moving to Singapore, Heidi Tian was deep in the world of banking—think long hours and fast-paced cities. But after becoming a mum, her priorities started to shift. She wanted more balance, and when she got to Singapore in 2012, something clicked: where were the big, fun, indoor play spaces for kids? That question planted the seed for <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-kiztopia-indoor-playground-marina-square/">Kiztopia</a>.</p>
<p>Leaving behind a steady corporate job to start something from scratch wasn’t easy—there were delays, tough calls and plenty of unknowns. But when she walked into her first completed playground, filled with colour, exploration and wide-eyed kids, it all felt worth it. We speak to Heidi about how her childhood inspired her love for play and exploration, how she started one of the region’s largest <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-indoor-playgrounds-babies-toddlers-kids-activities/">indoor playground</a> chains (Kiztopia has 18 outlets across Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia!), and what drives her as a parent.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/category/mama/that-mama/" target="_blank" rel="follow index noopener">Read our past That Mama interviews here</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What was your life like before moving to Singapore in 2012?</em></strong></p>
<p>Before moving to Singapore, I spent most of my career in banking, working in the fast-paced financial hubs of the U.S., China, and Hong Kong. While I enjoyed the structured corporate world, becoming a mother shifted my priorities. I found myself searching for more ways to balance career ambitions with family life. When I moved to Singapore, I noticed a gap in the market where there weren’t many large-scale indoor play experiences that combined fun with learning. That realisation ultimately planted the seed for Kiztopia.</p>
<p><em><strong>Having lived in the U.S., China and Hong Kong previously, what are the biggest differences you’ve noticed about raising kids there vs. in Singapore?</strong></em></p>
<p>Every country has a unique parenting culture. In the United States, there’s a strong emphasis on outdoor exploration and fostering independence. In China, structured learning plays a more significant role, and in Hong Kong, limited space means play is often centred around smaller activity zones. Singapore offers an ideal mix: it’s safe, has excellent infrastructure, and encourages both academic excellence and recreational play.</p>

<p><strong><em>The pressure of stepping into entrepreneurship from your corporate role must’ve been high. What were some of your most challenging moments, and what were your biggest motivators during that time?</em></strong></p>
<p>Stepping into entrepreneurship was both exhilarating and daunting. One of the biggest challenges was taking that first leap, leaving behind the stability of my corporate career and stepping into the unknown. The early days were filled with uncertainty, from securing the right locations to designing an entirely new concept that stood out in the market. There were moments when things didn’t go as planned—delays, operational hurdles, and the immense responsibility of leading a team.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, my biggest motivator was the vision of what Kiztopia could become. I believed deeply in creating a space where children could learn and grow through play. Seeing families enjoy our playgrounds and hearing parents share how Kiztopia has become a special part of their children’s lives made every challenge worthwhile. Another major source of strength came from my team and my family. Their unwavering support, belief and shared passion for our mission kept me going even in the toughest moments.</p>

<p><em><strong>What was your first reaction when you saw your first completed Kiztopia playground at Marina Square?</strong></em></p>
<p>It was an unforgettable moment—both surreal and incredibly emotional. After months of planning, designing, and overcoming countless obstacles, seeing the finished space come to life was overwhelming. I remember walking through the doors, taking in every detail—the vibrant play areas, the intricate designs, and the sheer scale of what we had created. It was a powerful mix of pride, relief, and excitement.</p>
<p>But the most fulfilling part was seeing children running in with wide-eyed wonder and hearing their laughter fill the space. That was the moment I knew we had created something special. It wasn’t just about building a playground; it was about bringing joy, fostering imagination, and creating a place where families could bond. That first <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-kiztopia-indoor-playground-marina-square/">Kiztopia at Marina Square</a> set the foundation for everything that followed, and even today, I still feel that same sense of excitement whenever we open a new outlet.</p>

<p><em><strong>When it comes to conceptualising indoor playgrounds, what’s your go-to for inspiration?</strong></em></p>
<p>A lot of my inspiration comes from being a parent myself. I constantly think about the kind of space I would want for my own children—safe, engaging, and designed to support learning. I also travel frequently to explore different play concepts worldwide.</p>
<p>Inspiration also comes from observing how children play, listening to parents, and staying attuned to global trends in family entertainment. Travel remains a huge source of inspiration, as seeing how other countries approach play and design sparks new ideas that we can adapt and innovate upon. Ultimately, the biggest inspiration comes from the children themselves—their curiosity, creativity, and boundless energy drive me to keep pushing boundaries.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are some places you’ve travelled to that have truly impressed you?</strong></em></p>
<p>Japan’s deep appreciation for storytelling is woven into every aspect of play, design, and experience. From iconic brands like Pokémon and Studio Ghibli to immersive attractions such as Disneyland Tokyo and Universal Studios Japan, storytelling is at the heart of engagement. Even in public spaces, interactive experiences—like teamLab Borderless and creative playgrounds—encourage imagination and exploration.</p>
<p>Similarly, Taiwan has a strong culture of blending education with entertainment. Places like Taipei’s children’s museums and themed experiential spaces create engaging environments where kids can learn through play. The emphasis on interactive storytelling and multi-sensory experiences reinforces the idea that play should be both enriching and fun.</p>
<p>Visiting these countries reinforced my belief that play should be more than just physical activity; it should spark creativity, evoke emotions, and leave lasting memories. At Kiztopia, we aim to bring that same sense of wonder to families by crafting experiences that go beyond play—where every child can embark on their adventure and create stories of their own.</p>

<p><em><strong>I’d love to hear more about your childhood. What were your best play/playground memories?</strong></em></p>
<p>Growing up in Xi’an, my childhood was all about outdoor adventures. There weren’t many structured playgrounds, so my best memories were of running freely in open spaces, climbing trees, and making up games with friends. I especially loved visiting parks with vast green fields, lakes, and winding trails—places that felt endless and full of possibility.</p>
<p>Nature played a huge role in my childhood. Some of my fondest moments were hiking with my family, breathing in the fresh air, and taking in the beauty of the landscapes around us. Those experiences instilled in me a deep love for exploration and adventure. They taught me that play wasn’t just about having fun—it was about discovery, creativity, and creating lifelong memories.</p>
<p><em><strong>How would you describe your parenting style?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’d say I’m a mix of hands-on and giving them space to grow. I believe in setting strong foundations, but also allowing my children the independence to make their own choices and learn from them. Encouragement, trust, and open communication are at the heart of my approach.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are some of your favourite rituals with your family today?</strong></em></p>
<p>No matter how busy my schedule gets, I try to carve out dedicated family time. Weekend breakfasts are a cherished tradition where we slow down and connect. Traveling together is another highlight, allowing us to bond and create memories. And, of course, play remains a part of our lives—whether through board games, outdoor adventures, or simply sharing laughter at home.</p>
<p><strong><em>Having a mum who owns and builds indoor playgrounds, do your kids consider themselves the luckiest in Singapore?</em></strong></p>
<p>They certainly have fun testing new playground features and being the first customers at Kiztopia. But to them, I’m simply ‘mum.’ Their joy and excitement remind me daily why I started this journey—to create spaces where families can bond and children can flourish.</p>

<p><em><strong>What are some things you hope your children learn from you when they grow up?</strong></em></p>
<p>I hope they develop resilience, a strong work ethic, and the courage to pursue their dreams. More than anything, I want them to understand the value of kindness, humility, and always staying grounded, no matter how successful they become.</p>
<p><em><strong>Throughout your journey of juggling entrepreneurship and motherhood, what are some surprising things you’ve learnt about yourself and parenthood?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’ve learned that I’m much stronger and more adaptable than I ever thought. Motherhood and entrepreneurship both require resilience, patience, and the ability to handle unpredictability. I’ve also realised the importance of embracing imperfection—there’s no perfect way to do either, and that’s okay.</p>
<p>Running Kiztopia has given me a deeper appreciation for the way children learn and grow through play. One surprising insight is how differently every child engages with play—some seek adventure, others prefer quiet observation, and many thrive through social interaction. It has reinforced my belief that there’s no “one-size-fits-all” approach to parenting; instead, providing the right environment and opportunities for kids to explore at their own pace is key.</p>
<p><em><strong>Quickfire questions:</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>I wish I had more time for&#8230;</strong> </em>Unplugged family time—just being present without distractions. And maybe catching up on sleep!</p>
<p><em><strong>I always feel saner after&#8230;</strong></em> Enjoying a quiet coffee, taking a walk with my husband, or sharing meaningful conversations with my kids—simple moments that remind me of what truly matters.</p>
<p><em><strong>As a mama, I wish I were better at…</strong></em> Letting go of the small stuff and staying fully present. It’s easy to get caught up in work, but children grow up in the blink of an eye!</p>
<p><em><strong>I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about&#8230;</strong> </em>New ideas for Kiztopia, upcoming projects, and how best to prepare my kids for the future.</p>
<p><strong><em>My favourite moment of the day is&#8230;</em></strong> Winding down with my family—whether over dinner or a casual chat. Those little moments mean everything.</p>

<p><strong>News: New Early &amp; Primary Years building opening in 2025 + New &#8216;Little Xplorers&#8217; Outdoor Learning programme</strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>XCL World Academy (XWA) is known for its strong academic outcomes, outstanding IBDP scores, and a warm, close-knit community. They&#8217;re also one of the first international schools in Singapore to comprehensively integrate AI education into the curriculum, offering programmes such as the AI Surestart programme, covering AI fundamentals, machine learning, and ethics. This year, they&#8217;ve introduced the new &#8216;Little Xplorers&#8217; Outdoor Learning programme, where students get to enjoy hands-on exploration, nurturing creativity, teamwork, and a lifelong passion for discovery in an outdoor setting.</p>

A highlight of the week is the highly anticipated Sing and Dance Off competition, where all Primary students are encouraged to express themselves and build confidence.

<p><b>News: New kindergarten campus to open September 2025<br />
</b></p>
<p>A brand-new IFS Kindergarten campus is set to open in September 2025! This upcoming campus will integrate eco-conscious innovations that minimise environmental impact while creating an inspiring, nurturing environment for young learners. One of its standout features is that it will be 100% solar-powered. Its Climate-Optimised Architecture includes low-emissivity double-glazed windows that block heat and UV rays while maximising natural daylight. These elements work hand-in-hand with intelligent cooling systems to ensure a comfortable learning environment in Singapore’s tropical climate, all while keeping energy consumption low.</p>
<p>The campus will also incorporate an Integrated Water Management System, capturing 100% of rainwater and passing it through a biomimetic purification process, which will, in turn, nourish the campus greenery with minimal environmental impact. Designed with a beautiful villa concept, the new campus will feature clusters of four spacious classrooms interconnected by a central communal area. At the heart of it all is a child-centric educational philosophy that emphasises autonomy, responsibility, emotional security, and social development. This approach supports each child’s individual rhythm of growth, helping them build confidence, independence, collaborative skills, and a lifelong love of learning.</p>

<p><strong>News: Students achieve Silver Award in the National Youth Achievement Award + Middleton Reads</strong></p>
<p>Middleton International School is proud to celebrate the achievements of two of its students &#8211; Grade 12’s Shreya Charpe and Grade 11’s Arielle Mascarenhas &#8211; who have been awarded the prestigious Silver Award in the National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA). This respected youth development programme builds resilience, leadership, and community service. From early morning volunteering at soup kitchens to leading sustainability projects&#8211;such as advocating for plastic-free living and launching a school composting initiative&#8211;Shreya and Arielle have gone above and beyond. Their efforts reflect a strong sense of purpose and social responsibility, turning classroom learning into meaningful real-world impact. The NYAA programme aligns with Middleton’s core values of resilience, responsibility, and mindfulness, while also helping students build robust portfolios for university and beyond.</p>
<p>Beyond NYAA, another student-led initiative, Middleton Reads, has been started by Grade 12 student Shalibeth Tiffany. The sustainable book-sharing platform is inspired by a simple yet powerful question: “What if students could get the books they want from fellow readers?” Designed to promote reading and reduce waste, the initiative enables students to exchange books within the school community. The school quickly embraced the idea, providing promotional support, mentorship, and a dedicated on-campus space to house the book exchange. What began as a personal project has blossomed into a vibrant, school-wide literacy movement. Fuelled by its success, Shalibeth expanded the initiative into School Reads and SG Reads. Her story has even been featured in the news!</p>

<p><strong>News: Overseas trips for Secondary School students + Service-learning activities<br />
</strong></p>
<p>At SMMIS, the annual Overseas Service Journey is a highlight for Secondary School students. Each trip is designed to broaden perspectives, foster empathy, and encourage students to discover the world around them. During the trip to Northern Thailand, students visited an orphanage, taught English at a local school, explored the famed Tham Luang Caves, and cared for elephants at an Ethical Elephant Sanctuary. Students also enjoyed breathtaking hikes, bike rides, zip lining, waterfalls, and a visit to the Night Market. More importantly, students gain a deeper understanding of their role in healing the world.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, students spent time at the Village of Hope, where they painted classrooms, planted gardens, and worked alongside local children and teachers to improve the school environment. It was a heartwarming exchange of cultures and kindness, made even more memorable by creating handmade gifts for the children they met. These overseas trips are a reflection of SMMIS values &#8211; teamwork, global citizenship, community responsibility, and service. For students who remain in Singapore, they take part in service-learning experiences. From sports to the arts, students engage in local initiatives that build leadership, empathy, and a strong sense of social responsibility. Last year, they partnered with Waterway Watch to clean up local waterways and participated in inclusive sports activities, learning how young people with physical challenges experience play and competition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="first">Have you tried glamping in Singapore? Whether you want to go outdoor glamping on the East Coast, Sentosa, Lazarus Island, indoor glamping or even glamping at the zoo, here’s our guide to glamping in Singapore with fairy lights, plush mattresses and even air-con!</h2>
<p>Glamping in Singapore is basically super posh camping! If you&#8217;re keen to take the kiddos <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-pulau-ubin-camping-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">camping</a> but just can&#8217;t deal with setting your own tent up, or sleeping on a hard surface with no aircon, then you&#8217;ll want to try glamping! It combines the wonders of sleeping outside with the creature comforts of a <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/chalets-singapore-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chalet</a> or <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/travel-kid-friendly-hotels-family-staycation-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotel staycation</a>. Glamping in Singapore is a unique way to spend the night outdoors, whether for <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-40th-birthday-ideas-experiences-singapore/">a big birthday party</a>, a romantic getaway, or good old-fashioned family bonding. Check out our roundup of all the best spots to take the kids glamping in Singapore!</p>

<p><strong>What does it mean to go glamping?</strong><br />
Glamping is a word blend of &#8220;glamorous&#8221; and &#8220;camping&#8221; — taking all the fun of camping in a tent but elevating the experience. It&#8217;s basically a more glamorous form of camping that includes already set up tents, often proper beds or plush mattresses, electricity (and sometimes air-con!), cushions, <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/eat-best-picnic-singapore-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picnic</a> tables and at one glamping spot a BBQ or pizza offer!</p>
<p><strong>How is glamping different to camping?<br />
</strong>Glamping is definitely a more comfortable experience! But if you&#8217;re keen to teach the kids how to set up a tent, make your own food on a campfire, and rough it for the night, glamping won&#8217;t quite cut it. You&#8217;ll defo get a better night&#8217;s sleep glamping though! As with proper camping, when you go glamping in Singapore you&#8217;ll still need to <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/activities/fun-and-recreation/camping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply for an NParks camping permit for free</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How much is glamping in Singapore?</strong><br />
Glamping in Singapore is not as cheap as camping but more affordable than a hotel stay. The cheapest outdoor glamping we found is from $210 per night for 2 pax, and the most expensive glamping at Singapore Zoo is a whopping $1,699 per tent!</p>

<p>This one&#8217;s sure to be a hit with the little ones. <em>Elementary </em>by Tonoptik from Montenegro may look like a normal flat screen.

<p>Whether you want to spend some quality time with your baby, meet other parents with similar-aged bubs or want to start their education at a young age, checking out a baby playgroup in Singapore is your best bet. While the newborn phase can definitely feel like a bit of a sleep-deprived blur at times, soon enough, you&#8217;ll be itching to get out of the house and <em>do </em>something more than just stare at your adorable munchkin on a play mat. From music and movement baby classes (even newborns like listening to songs!) to <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/best-swim-schools-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swimming</a> and messy play, there are heaps of playgroups out there to stimulate babies &#8211; not exactly <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/category/learn/enrichment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enrichment classes</a>, but bubs will develop in leaps and bounds in a nurturing, age-appropriate manner. We&#8217;ve included parent- and caretaker-accompanied baby playgroups, as well as drop-off <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-childcare-centres-singapore/">infant care</a> facilities for working parents to cover the full range of possibilities out there!</p>

<p><strong>Playgroup for: </strong>19 months &#8211; 6 years old</p>
<p>NAFA Arts Preschool isn’t just another preschool, it’s where young children grow and thrive through the enriching power of the arts. Their unique arts-integrated curriculum blends visual arts, music, dance, speech and drama into every aspect of early childhood development. In the Playgroup programme (2 years old), children enjoy imaginative play and sensory exploration, all supported by artistic experiences. From storytelling with music to finger painting that enhances fine motor skills, each activity is designed to nurture communication, curiosity and confidence.</p>
<p>As children move into Pre-Nursery and Nursery, they explore more structured learning while continuing to explore the world through creative expression. Early literacy and numeracy are introduced through hands-on arts experiences that encourage independence, collaboration and a joy for learning. In Kindergarten, children at NAFA Arts Preschool are immersed in a rich environment where academic and social-emotional growth go hand in hand with artistic discovery. Whether composing rhythms, expressing feelings through movement, or creating their own artworks, they build essential life skills that prepare them for primary school and beyond.</p>

<p>Did you know that immersing your child in the world of music and singing from an early age can work wonders for their speech, brain development, and social skills? That’s exactly what VOCA Academy’s Bouncing Bubs (6 to 18 months) and Tiny Tots (16 months to 3 years) playgroups are all about! Their baby and toddler music exploration classes aim to strengthen the bond between parent and child while nurturing communication, motor skills and emotional development. Babies and toddlers engage in themed classes, whether it’s exploring animal sounds through Farmyard Fun, making waves in the Ocean Orchestra, or revving up fun in Transport Tunes.</p>
<p>Through activities such as singing, dancing, instrument play and storytelling, kiddos learn about music and language in a sensory-rich experience. What’s more, VOCA Academy incorporates basic sign language to encourage pre-verbal babies to communicate effectively. Each 45-minute baby class invites two adults to join the fun and is priced from $40. They have recently launched a new programme Singing Superstars (3.5 &#8211; 6 years old) to ignite your little one&#8217;s inner superstar through fun and engaging singing and musicianship training.

<p><strong>Playgroup for:</strong> 4 months to 6 years old</p>
<p>The Music Scientist offers a thoughtfully designed programme for children aged 4 months to 6 years, blending music, movement, sensory play and science to support cognitive, physical, and emotional development in a fun and engaging way. This playgroup in Singapore is known for its multi-sensory, hands-on approach that encourages kids to explore their surroundings while building essential skills such as social interaction, confidence, and self-expression. With an experiential learning style that taps into multiple intelligences including musical, bodily-kinesthetic, logical, naturalistic, and linguistic, children enjoy activities like singing, dancing, acting, and collaboration, all while discovering the joy of music and science.</p>
<p>We love that each themed module (refreshed every four weeks!) comes with exclusive in-house songs that can be used at home during daily routines like mealtimes or bedtime. These songs also infuse general knowledge and educational aspects that can help nurture early brain development. For toddlers aged 18 to 47 months, there’s even a Preschool Ready programme available in both English and Chinese to help ease the transition into formal learning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>“Parenting in Germany focuses on learning through play. Kids learn to be independent and make their own decisions&#8211;life skills difficult to teach in a classroom environment.”</h2>
<p>Oh Chyi Haur and his wife Aida Oh live in Munich, Germany, with their 14-year-old daughter. Both Chyi Haur and his wife were originally Singaporeans, but Chyi Haur became a Swedish citizen 3-4 years ago, while their daughter Chloe is both Singaporean and Swedish. The family lived in Sweden, Japan, and Indonesia before moving to Munich, where Chyi Haur worked as a Business Navigation Manager at IKEA.</p>
<p>We chat to Chyi Haur about life in Europe and how it differs from Singapore. Chyi Haur shares how kids in Germany learn to be independent and make their own decisions, and there is more work-life balance. We hear how the family has adapted with Chloe learning first Swedish and then German within a few months of moving to each country, and how they stay in touch with their Singaporean roots and the community. Read on for why Chyi Haur can’t imagine moving back to Singapore and what the family miss most from their home country.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/tag/overseas-mama/">Read more Overseas Family Stories here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>When did you move to Germany and what were the reasons you decided to move?</strong></em></p>
<p>We moved to Munich, Germany, in August 2024 because of my new job with IKEA Germany. We were living in Älmhult in Sweden before this. Älmhult is the birthplace of IKEA and one of the corporate HQ locations in Sweden, where I worked previously.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229742" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-9.jpg" alt="Overseas Mama - Oh Chyi Haur - parenting in Germany &amp; Sweden" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-9.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-9-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-9-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Your family has lived in a few foreign countries – any favourites?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, we have lived in Sweden for 7 years before moving to Germany. Before Sweden, we were living in Japan for 2 years and prior to that, Indonesia for 13 years. I think each country has its charm. We love each of the countries we lived in – Japan for sushi and onsen, not forgetting the Japanese efficiency, Sweden for IKEA and meatballs, nature and work/life balance and Germany also for nature and historical architecture.</p>
<p>But if we had to select one country, it would be Sweden. We lived there for 7 years. This was also the formation years for Chloe in elementary school education. The nature there is amazing and my daughter also had the opportunity to pick up many life skills and activities (like figure skating, horse riding and piano). Chloe was able to compete in Figure Skating in<br />
several regional domestic competitions during this time. We were also able to take our boat to explore the many small islands in the lake near our house.</p>
<p>As I work for IKEA Chloe had the opportunity to be featured in two IKEA Global video productions–the <a href="https://youtu.be/5e8edMiYsJY?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Launch of the BYGGLEK Collection</a> in 2020 ,which was a collaboration between IKEA and LEGO where the video played in all IKEA stores globally–and the other was the <a href="https://youtu.be/Wp6W93bed18?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promotional video of IKEA Museum in Älmhult</a>. Yes, there is an IKEA Museum! We are extremely proud that a Singaporean child was involved in these two videos.</p>

<p><em><strong>Favourite aspect about living in Germany?</strong></em></p>
<p>Munich, where we are living now, is a big city compared to where we came from in Sweden. The convenience of living is here, e.g. malls, restaurants, etc. It’s a safe city with plenty of open spaces, and it’s family-friendly too. A big plus is that Munich is at the centre of Western Europe, so travelling to other parts of Europe is easy. In the short time we have been in Munich, we have made numerous road trips to Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and France.</p>
<p>At the same time, Munich is close to the Alps and nature and numerous lakes and can be easily reached within an hour. There is always something fun to do as a family!</p>
<figure id="attachment_229740" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-229740" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-229740" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-8.jpg" alt="Overseas Mama - Oh Chyi Haur - parenting in Germany &amp; Sweden" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-8.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-8-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-8-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-229740" class="wp-caption-text">Visiting Basel during one of the numerous trips while living in Germany.</figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>And the worst part?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think the frustrating part of living in Germany is the bureaucracy. Dealing with public authorities means that every “I” needs to be dotted and every “t” needs to be crossed. We have been &#8216;warned&#8217; before moving, but to experience this first-hand is really frustrating.</p>
<p>I also feel that the language barrier can be challenging. Although English is widely spoken, Munich, being in Bavaria (one of the most conservative states in Germany), people are not as receptive to speaking in English, even if they see you struggling to speak in German. Thus, it is crucial to pick up the German language quickly in order to survive in this environment.</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you think parenting (and schools) in Germany differs from Singapore? What do you appreciate most about it?</strong></em></p>
<p>Parenting in Germany, similar to many Western European countries, focuses on learning through play. Academic pressure is much lesser than that in Singapore. Kids in Germany also learn to be independent and make their own decisions within limits, and take responsibility early. Such are life skills which children learn at a young age and are difficult to teach in a typical classroom environment.</p>
<p>There is much more work-life balance. Kids are not burdened with a tremendous amount of homework in Germany. Generous parental leave also allows parents to be able to spend more time with their children.</p>
<p>My wife and I really appreciate such an environment. We see that our daughter, Chloe, grows up happy. This is the most important factor for us.</p>
<figure id="attachment_229736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-229736" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-229736" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-4.jpg" alt="Overseas Mama - Oh Chyi Haur - parenting in Germany &amp; Sweden" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-4.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-4-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-4-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-229736" class="wp-caption-text">Chloe horse riding.</figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>What do you find is the hardest part of being a parent living in a foreign country?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think the toughest part is the limited opportunity to be connected to the home country, especially our extended family in Singapore. Physical interactions with our Singapore extended family are generally limited to the summer vacation trips back to Singapore.</p>
<p>Another aspect which we are struggling with is that, as we are also not proficient in the German language, we are not able to support Chloe in some of her schoolwork. This can be frustrating. However, our fears are really unfounded, as we can see Chloe is able to manage new languages (both German and Swedish) on her own.</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you and your partner juggle work and dividing up family roles?</strong></em></p>
<p>My wife loves to cook. She is able to prepare many delicious local Singapore dishes like Hainanese Chicken Rice, Laksa, Nasi Lemak, Lodeh, Mee Rebus, Sushi, Tempura and many more! As such, she prepares the meals at home. I do the rest. We also agree that I will monitor Chloe&#8217;s schoolwork.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is there something that you do to keep your child in touch with their Singaporean roots?</strong></em></p>
<p>Chloe is able to keep in touch with her Singapore roots through the famous Singapore food which my wife cooks and frequent video calls to her grandparents in Singapore.</p>
<p>We also encourage Chloe to use Singapore as a reference or material in her school projects whenever possible.</p>
<figure id="attachment_229738" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-229738" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-229738" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-6.jpg" alt="Overseas Mama - Oh Chyi Haur - parenting in Germany &amp; Sweden" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-6.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-6-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-6-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-229738" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Locally adapted Lohei prepared by my wife.&#8221;</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>On raising multilingual children …</strong><br />
It is super important that children are at least bilingual. We are happy that Chloe is able to communicate in English, German and Swedish. We are amazed at how fast she is able to pick up languages.</p>
<p>When we first moved to Sweden, Chloe did not speak any Swedish. From when the school year started in August till after the New Year, we saw Chloe´s Swedish competency improve tremendously.</p>
<p>Now, after moving to Germany, we also have a similar experience. Having no German knowledge when school started in September, after the New Year, Chloe is now able to communicate with her friends comfortably in German.</p>
<p>My wife is Malay and I am Chinese. As we predominantly speak English at home, her exposure to Chinese and Malay is limited. We are trying to expose Chloe to both languages by speaking to her, but it has not been an easy journey.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is the first thing you do each time you go back to Singapore?</strong></em></p>
<p>Laksa has always been my comfort food. Whenever we go back to Singapore, I will always have a bowl of Laksa at Changi Airport. Even though it may not be the best Laksa, it is good enough for me at that point in time!</p>
<p>As for my wife, she misses Mee Rebus and thus that will be the first meal she will enjoy when we return.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you always bring back from Singapore for yourself and for your child?</strong></em></p>
<p>Chloe always likes Tapioca Chilli Crackers and Chicken Floss. My wife will bring back seasonings like Prima Taste, Indonesian / Malaysian seasonings. If it is during the festive period in Singapore when we go back, e.g. Chinese New Year or Hari Raya Aidilfitri, then we will also bring back kueh bangkit, pineapple tarts, love letters, etc.</p>

<p><em><strong>Top five places in or around Munich you would recommend to parents travelling with kids and why.</strong></em></p>
<p>If you are travelling with kids, here are our top 5 picks to visit in Munich:</p>
<p>1. Deutsches Museum: This is the world´s largest Museum of Science and Technology. It also has a dedicated hands-on area for kids, plus interactive exhibits on space, aviation and physics. It also features real planes, submarines and trains for kids to explore. Definitely fun for all ages.</p>
<p>2. Olympiapark and BMW World: where the 1972 Munich Olympics were held. Today, Olympiapark has boat rides, playgrounds and an abundance of green open spaces for kids to run around. Next to Olympiapark is BMW World is the Global Corporate HQ of BMW, which has many interactive displays of BMW vehicles and also futuristic vehicles.</p>
<p>3. Englischer Garten: One of the largest urban parks in the world. It is even bigger than Central Park in New York. Families can enjoy a picnic with plenty of space for kids to run and play, and there are several beer gardens. It is also possible to rent paddle boats here. One of the quirks in Englischer Garten is definitely Eisbach River, where you can watch people surfing on a river, a unique Munich attraction! People are surfing on this part of the river regardless of the season!</p>
<p>4. Hellabrunn Zoo: This is a highly rated zoo. Many animals are kept in large, natural enclosures and are cageless. There is a petting zoo for kids, interactive exhibits and adventure playgrounds. The zoo is located on the banks of the Isar River, so you can enjoy a scenic walk along the Isar River after the Zoo.</p>
<p>5. <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/eat-beer-oktoberfest-singapore/">Oktoberfest</a>. How not to miss Oktoberfest in Munich? Families with kids can also enjoy the world-famous Oktoberfest if they are visiting in late September. There are family-friendly beer tents offering traditional food like pretzels and apple strudel. There are rides (carousels, Ferris Wheel and mini roller coaster), traditional puppet shows for younger kids, Funfair games and Food Stalls.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is the local cuisine like and do you eat out a lot or cook at home?</strong></em></p>
<p>Typical local cuisine consists of Weißwurst (or white sausage) served with Mustard and pretzel; Pork Knuckle served with Potato dumplings and sauerkraut and Kartoffelsalat (Potato<br />
Salad). We generally eat at home as my wife loves to cook (as mentioned above). On important occasions like birthdays, anniversaries or weekends then we eat out.</p>
<figure id="attachment_229737" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-229737" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-229737" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-5.jpg" alt="Overseas Mama - Oh Chyi Haur - parenting in Germany &amp; Sweden" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-5.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-5-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/oh-chyi-haur-germany-sweden-5-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-229737" class="wp-caption-text">Road trip to Paris while living in Germany.</figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>What’s the one thing you would miss about Germany if you moved away?</strong></em></p>
<p>We would definitely miss the Christmas markets. <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/kid-friendly-christmas-markets-europe-families/">German Christmas markets</a> are world-renowned. The Munich Christmas Market is one of the oldest and most famous, dating back to the 14th Century. The atmosphere, especially when it is snowing&#8211;the scent and aroma Glühwein (mulled wine), Bratwurst, etc, are something words cannot describe. Some of the Christmas ornaments are so unique that you cannot find them elsewhere.</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you stay connected with the Singaporean community?</strong></em></p>
<p>Since we first started living abroad, we have always made an effort to connect with the Singapore Community, either through the Singapore Embassy activities or social media groups. At the same time, we also try to help new Singaporeans moving in by offering advice and recommendations on practicalities to hopefully reduce the stress of moving to a new country.</p>
<p>In Sweden, I was the founding head of my alma mater&#8217;s Alumni (Nanyang Technological University, NTU Singapore). I organise gatherings for fellow alumni in Sweden to connect, network and also stay connected with the University in Singapore. For my efforts, NTU Singapore has awarded me the NTU Alumni Service Award 2024.</p>
<p>In Oct 2024, the Swedish King made a state visit to Singapore, I also shared my reflections in the Straits Times Singapore commemorating the visit.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you dread and look forward to most if you were to move back to Singapore?</strong></em></p>
<p>I cannot imagine moving back to Singapore now. The continuous stressful rat-race culture and the hot, humid weather are something which I do not think I will be able to adapt to, especially being away from Singapore for more than 20 years now.</p>
<p>However, the abundance of fantastic local Singapore food is something we do look forward to. Even at 2am, it is still possible to find great food&#8211;and all the 24/7 convenience stores like 7-11, Cheers, etc, what a treat!</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you think Singaporeans can benefit from living overseas?</strong></em></p>
<p>We feel that it is extremely beneficial for Singaporeans to live overseas if there is an opportunity to do so. The world is so much bigger than our little red dot. Exposure to different global cultures and perspectives may lead to better appreciation and tolerance. We will be so blinded if we are only living in our Singapore bubble, oblivious to the speed of development that the world is going at.</p>
<p>At the same time, this can also lead to appreciating Singapore&#8217;s strengths even more (e.g. safety, public infrastructure, public transport system, strong governance, etc), which many Singaporeans take for granted.</p>

<h2>What to Know Before Choosing a Gynae in Singapore</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Which <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/pregnancy/where-to-give-birth-in-singapore-public-vs-private-maternity-hospitals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hospitals</a> they are admitted to deliver at:</strong> Think about which ones are convenient to where you live. While most of the gynaes on our list below can deliver at multiple hospitals, they might not make it to you in time for your birth if you deliver somewhere other than near their main clinic.</li>
<li><strong>Costs: </strong>Consider which doctors work with your insurance. Many doctors offer full antenatal packages that cover checkups, scans, and even delivery, but it may work out cheaper to pay on an a la carte basis.</li>
<li><strong>Your choice of gynae:</strong> Do you prefer a female gynae or are you not fussed? Interestingly, most of the gynaecologists in Singapore considered most “<a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/pregnancy/sassy-mamas-guide-to-a-natural-birth-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pro-natural birth</a>” are men! And yet almost everyone on Team Sassy Mama had a female gynae (some of our testimonials are below).</li>
<li><strong>Wait times</strong>. Be sure to ask around about wait times. Doctors at public hospitals (like NUH and KKH) tend to have much longer ones (we’re talking <em>hours</em>). In our experience, it’s always best to try to book the first appointment of the day if you can. The nature of OBGYNs, of course, is that they can get called away to deliver a baby at any time, which then throws their appointment schedules into chaos.</li>
<li><strong>Support staff: </strong>Who is on your doctor&#8217;s support staff? Several gynaes on this list work with midwives who provide an extra layer of care and attention to patients and can be invaluable both during labour and in the postnatal stage.</li>
<li><strong>Backup partners:</strong> If your OBGYN is away when you give birth, make sure you’re just as comfortable with their alternate.</li>
</ul>

“Dr. Chee Jing Jye delivered my son nine years ago and I couldn&#8217;t have been happier. She is a highly experienced OBGYN, with more than 15 years of practice. Before joining private practice in 2010, Dr. Chee was the Consultant and Head of the Peripartum Unit, Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. During her time as Head of the Peripartum Unit, Dr. Chee has overseen the medical management of the KK Hospital Delivery Suite, with over 12,000 deliveries annually. I am a worrier by nature but when it comes to pregnancy, it just took another level. So when we arrived in Singapore and found out we were pregnant, I wanted to find an OBGYN that I could trust. With her background, I knew I would be in good hands. In addition, her calm and sweet personality was the perfect match for me. She accompanied me throughout my pregnancy, reassuring me every step of the way. The delivery went smoothly and I have recommended her to many of my friends since. Oh, and I never had to wait too long for any appointments! –<em>Emilie</em></p>

Renowned for introducing <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/pregnancy/birth-stories-real-singapore-mamas-share-their-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">water births</a> at NUH, Dr. Chong (often referred to as <em>Professor </em>Chong – he’s also Dean of NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine) has a reputation as one of the most pro-natural birth gynaecologists in Singapore. We have to say we also love his selection of natty bowties.</p>
<p>“Professor Chong is very popular, and NUH is very busy in general, so expect long wait times (I&#8217;m talking hours). However, my appointments were never rushed, and Professor Chong was happy to answer all my questions. Professor Chong was very supportive of my birth plan, however, my little one arrived very quickly in the early hours of the morning so he didn&#8217;t make it to the hospital in time for the birth.” –<em>Jessica</em></p>

In addition to her popular obstetrics practice where she’s a huge advocate for a natural birth, Dr. Choo is well-versed in other gynaecological issues such as infections, endometriosis, fertility challenges and ovarian cysts. She also has a special interest in menopausal care and female sexual dysfunction. If you&#8217;re after a female gynaecologist in Singapore who will put you at ease, look no further.</p>
<p>“Dr. Choo and her staff are warm, relaxed and friendly, and she is always happy to answer questions and offer down-to-earth advice. Her office was always buzzing with patients (book early in the day or you may have a long wait ahead of you), but I never felt rushed, and always appreciated her personal touch. When I was pregnant with #2, she let my then-3-year-old daughter sit with her to look at the ultrasound; to this day Maggie still compares all doctors against Dr. Choo! She was completely open to my birth plan and respectful of my desire to pursue a natural, drug-free birth.” –<em>Kate</em></p>

<p>“I started out seeing Dr Freda Khoo at KKH and she saw me through my pregnancy till the birth of my second baby, and my husband and I had a wonderful experience with her. Dr Khoo doesn’t just talk to you like a doctor and an expert – she gets to “friend level.” That’s how much she shows she cares: it feels like she’s taken a personal interest in you, your family and your well-being. When Dr. Khoo left to start her own practice at Thomson Medical Centre, as much of a fan of KKH as I was, I went along with her! Dr. Khoo listens to her patients and if anything, her soothing voice alone will calm your nerves in any situation.” –<em>Nadia</em></p>

<p>“I started seeing Dr. Jasmine at Thomson Medical Centre from my second trimester onwards. As a first time mum, I liked that she explained what’s next and what to expect to me, as it reduced my anxiety of not knowing what’s to come for labour. She gave useful advice and tips on birth preparation and also respected my wish for a natural birth. Check-up sessions were always a breeze – I didn’t have to wait for long hours. She was very responsive during my panic call in the wee hours before labour. Post labour, her stitches were clean and I healed well.” –<em>Atikah</em></p>

Since she was at her <a href="https://www.nuh.com.sg/patients-visitors/Facilities-Amenities/Facilities/Pages/default.aspx?keywords=Jurong%20Clinic%20for%20Women">other clinic in Jurong</a>, she was absent during a portion of my active labour period but came just in time to deliver the baby.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Looking for a student care centre in Singapore to make sure your child is well taken care of after school with academic help, enrichment and activities? Here&#8217;s our guide, including info on subsidies, locations and student care fees</h2>
<p>While preschool and kindergarten-aged children have <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-childcare-centres-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">childcare centres</a>, primary school and lower secondary school-going children have student care centres. Student care centres provide safe, conducive environments for children who don&#8217;t have care arrangements at home during after-school hours or <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-singapore-international-school-holidays-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school holidays</a>. At student care, children get to fill their afternoons with holistic activities and after-school programmes and more importantly, complete their homework so they won&#8217;t have to do it in the evenings at home!</p>
<p>In addition, student care centres provide meals. On top of homework supervision and meals, different student care options provide after-school programmes like music, sports, outdoor play and field trips!</p>
<h3>Types of student care centres</h3>
<p>All MOE primary schools have a school-based student care centre. These school-based student care centres make it easy for kids to go from their classrooms to student care without leaving the school! Only children from primary school can enrol in the school&#8217;s student care.</p>
<p>If your child is already enrolled in a primary school, you can check with the school about the student care application procedure and criteria during orientation or at any time after your child&#8217;s confirmed enrolment. A few main operators of school-based student care include NASCANS, Pro-Teach, Big Heart, YMCA, Morning Star and Commit Learning.</p>
<h3>Community-based student care centres</h3>
<p>If the school-based student care is fully subscribed, you can consider a community-based student care centre near your home or your child&#8217;s school. This could mean your child will have to head to the student care centre themselves, but it also gives them the chance to meet and make friends with children from other nearby schools, widening their social circle.</p>
<h3>How much are student care fees in Singapore?</h3>
<p>Student care fees start from $200 per month. You&#8217;re likely to pay less if you qualify for certain subsidies at MSF-registered student care centres under the Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) scheme. <a href="https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/schemes/SCFA/student-care-fee-assistance-scfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check your eligibility here.</a></p>

<p>Changemakers by Seed Campus is not a typical, cookie-cutter student care centre in Singapore.

<p>The team that is made up of ex-MOE teachers here encourage students to be responsible in daily routines and take ownership of their own learning. Though academic support is readily available, Changemakers gives students the opportunity to develop essential life skills.

<h3>The Canopy: Instagrammable event plaza</h3>

<p>There are many reasons to be in awe of The Canopy, Geneo’s 3,000-square-metre event plaza. This area at the entrance of Geneo is visually stunning, with mass engineered timber (MET) pillars towering some 27 metres tall, branching off to a louvred glass canopy. It’s also where plenty of events are expected to take place, with a capacity of about 300 pax. On a regular day, though, you can simply hang out at this naturally ventilated space and enjoy the view before you.</p>

Key features include two lockable nursing rooms with armchairs, but there&#8217;s no table or space to park your stroller in the room. However, there are two changing stations and a waiting area, so park your elder tots there and make use of the power points to charge your devices. There are also family toilets with a diaper-changing area at Bedok Mall, a children&#8217;s loo and a baby seat within the handicapped restrooms.</p>

Changi seriously sets a global standard for its family-friendly facilities, with a whopping 30 baby care facilities spanning its four terminals, in both public and private areas. The nursing rooms are as modern and spacious as the airport itself, offering pretty much everything you need, plus a diaper dispenser in case you forgot to pack those! Each and every room is equipped with a hot water dispenser and clean and comfy changing facilities, and many also have dedicated, private nursing stalls as well. Our hands-down fave is the Peranakan-themed nursing room in gorgeous Terminal 4<em>.</em> Unsurprisingly, this most modern terminal offers no less than eleven nursing and changing rooms, including five in public areas like the departure and arrivals halls.</p>

ION has some of our favourite restrooms in Singapore so it’s little wonder that their nursing rooms are just as nice. In addition to standard amenities like a hot water dispenser and changing tables, on B3 and B4 you’ll also discover a bottle warmer and handy diaper vending machine if you find yourself in a pinch (has definitely happened to us on more than one occasion)! We also like that these rooms have plenty of room for a stroller. Other amenities include a hot/cold water dispenser, cushioned changing tables, bottle warmer, diaper vending machine and separate nursing alcoves. Their baby rooms can only accommodate one family, but you can lock the entire room and have it all to yourself.</p>

Ngee Ann City’s nursing rooms are functional but minimal, so head over to the nearby Takashimaya baby care room (see entry no. 63) if you’re looking for a premium nursing room experience. The nursing room here has an armchair and a table, a changing table and sink. Locks and power points are only available in the rooms on Level B2.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Level 4 (next to restrooms)<br />
We hear horror stories about workin’ mamas lining up to pump here – the only nursing room in the heart of Raffles Place (we know offices should all have their own pumping facilities, but sadly that just isn’t the case right now). That said, for mamas who find themselves needing to pump (or toting their babies around the CBD), head to Level 4 to get the job done (but try not to go at peak times like lunch!). Note that this room is <em>also </em>too small to fit a pram. Amenities include a hot/cold water dispenser, changing table, sink, chair for nursing and power points.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Level 2<br />
The nursing room at this shiny mall and office building on Shenton Way is a welcome addition to the CBD area (though nursing rooms are still too far and few between!). Here, the nursing room is separate from the changing area, which is good for efficiency’s sake but does create some pretty tight quarters (there’s just enough space to fit a stroller into each, though). The nursing rooms also have a hot/cold water dispenser, power points, a padded changing table and sink, as well as separate nursing alcoves with one seat.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Levels 1 (near the Suntec City Tourist Hub and the Adidas Store) and 2 (near Toys R Us and the Convention Centre).<br />
Clean and <em>very </em>spacious, the main Suntec nursing room on Level 1 offers two nursing alcoves with comfy chairs, along with multiple padded changing tables, and even a bottle steriliser. NB: The nursing room on Level 2 is much smaller, with just a single nursing seat. You can expect sinks, a bottle steriliser in the Level 1 nursing room, separate nursing alcoves with comfy chairs, a hot/cold water dispenser, cushioned changing tables and power points.</p>

<h2>63. Suntec City Convention Centre</h2>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Levels 1 and 2; Tower 3 (next to Toys R’ Us)<br />
There are multiple nursing rooms scattered across Suntec, but with it being a hub for a lot of working mamas, it’s a real shame there aren’t any power points to help with expressing milk. The nursing cubicle has curtains instead of locks, and there are changing stations and a hot and cold water dispenser.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Children&#8217;s Department, Level 4<br />
This has long held the crown as the single best nursing room in Singapore, and in our humble opinion, no one’s come for it yet! Super clean, spacious, and comfortable, this family lounge has room for a whole gaggle of strollers. The five separate nursing areas each feature a comfy seat and a dedicated changing table. You’ll also find toddler high chairs (with trays!) and even a Huggies diaper dispenser. There’s also a spacious seating area with a TV where you can send bored older kiddos if need be. This room is worth seeking out if you find yourself on Orchard, and your bub needs a breather. And if – due to its popularity – it’s crowded, you’ll be relieved to know there are additional nice nursing rooms elsewhere in Ngee Ann City. Other amenities include a hot/cold water dispenser, power points and sinks.</p>

Spacious – with enough space to wheel in a couple of strollers – this nursing room is usually pretty jumping due to all the baby-friendly amenities nearby.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tufting is the art of making your own unique rug! Visit these tuft clubs and studios for carpet tufting workshops in Singapore to learn how to tuft a rug designed by you in just a few hours.</h2>
<p>Tufting, along with other artisanal hobbies like crocheting and knitting, has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest, courtesy of TikTok. Perhaps it is the authenticity of handmade crafts that appeals to many, especially in this age of mass manufacturing. Tufting – the latest addition to viral DIY crafts ­– refers to a method of weaving textiles where yarn is looped through fabric, usually to make rugs.</p>
<p><strong>Rug <span class="il">tufting</span> for beginners:</strong></p>
<p>Trending clips have made modern rug tufting look so satisfyingly simple, which is perfect for beginners. You don’t even need sewing experience to create tufting designs of every conceivable shape, size and colour. All that’s required is some patience in manoeuvring an automated tufting gun that rapidly punches needle into fabric, transforming loose threads into eye-catching designs. If you are looking for a bonding <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/fun-activities-for-teenagers-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activity to do with your teen</a>, why not join a tufting workshop in Singapore? Get ready to craft your own masterpieces at these local studios offering tufting classes.</p>

<h2>Visiting a dentist in Singapore: FAQs</h2>

<p><strong>When should I make the first visit to a paediatric dentist?</strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Paediatric Dentistry (AAPD) recommends that you schedule an appointment at a kids’ dentist or family dental clinic within six months from when their first tooth erupts or by the age of one. However, there are also paediatric dentists who recommend visits around the age of three, unless your child has specific dental concerns.</p>
<p>Dental experts agree that the earlier you begin this routine of visiting the dentist, the healthier their teeth, gums and mouth will be. In fact, early visits to the dentist can also help prevent cavities and tooth decay and other serious dental issues later on in life.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>What should I do if my child is scared of visiting the dental clinic?</strong></p>
<p>Several paediatric dentists have observed that parents may project their own fears onto their children. Instead of asking your kids to be brave or to not worry–these phrases can instil fear or doubt that may not have been present–let them read a book or a watch a video on visiting the dentist.</p>
<p>This can help calm their nerves, which can also help develop healthy dental habits in the long run. You can also prep your child at home by practising how to open their mouth for the dentist or by pretending to count their teeth with a flashlight.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>What can we expect on a first visit to a paediatric dentist or dental clinic?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to schedule your child&#8217;s first visit with a paediatric dentist, as these experts are trained to manage children in the areas of children&#8217;s growth and development, behaviour management and child psychology. Many paediatric dentists will do simple things like count your child’s teeth and offer a lighthearted introduction to the purpose of a dental visit.</p>
<p>Some dentists may discuss your child’s diet with you and offer tips for good oral hygiene and teeth cleaning. This is also a good time to ask your kid’s dentist about any concerns you may have. Once your child is comfortable with their paediatric dentist, stick to a routine and bring them to the same dentist for subsequent dental appointments.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>How can I encourage good dental hygiene at home?</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to maintain good oral hygiene after your child’s first visit to a dental clinic in Singapore. Start by making brushing a habit twice a day. Invest in kid-friendly toothbrushes that are soft to medium in strength and teach your little one how to floss, too. The best way to cultivate good oral habits is to start by brushing your own teeth with your kids to set a good example.</p>
<p>You can also use reward systems or turn brushing and flossing into a fun game. Positive reinforcement is always a great way to hone good dental habits. Set a routine by ensuring your child brushes their teeth at the same time and place every day, or make it part of their nightly bath time. Sometimes, letting them watch a fun and helpful video can motivate them to brush their teeth regularly.</p>
<p>The most important way to help your child overcome their fear of the dentist is to look for kids&#8217; dentists that take the time to explain or patiently answer any questions your child may have. Make sure your child gets plenty of rest prior to the visit, and if they are shy or nervous at the first visit, it is perfectly alright to stop and try again another day.</p>
<p>Now that you’re prepared for your child’s first visit to the paediatric dentist, consider making an appointment at these dental clinics to keep their pearly whites shiny and bright!</p>

<p><strong>When is Rice Dumpling Festival 2025?</strong></p>
<p>The Chinese Dumpling Festival takes place on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese Lunar Calendar which is Monday, 31 May 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Boat Festival History</strong></p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival commemorates the death of Qu Yuan, a Chinese poet and minister during the Zhou Dynasty Warring States period who was banished and accused of treason. He later drowned himself in the river when the Chu capital was captured by Qin. Legend has it that he couldn’t be saved by locals who tried to race out in boats to reach him in time.</p>
<p>Fishermen beat their oars against the water to stop the man-eating fish in the river from devouring Qu Yuan’s body. Some say they threw cooked rice wrapped in leaves into the water, hoping that the fish would eat them instead. This legend has resulted in the celebratory Dragon Boat Festival with dragon boat races and the eating of rice dumplings wrapped in reed leaves.</p>
<p><strong>How to cook Rice Dumplings</strong></p>
<p>Rice dumplings are best eaten when they are steamed, but may also be eaten as sold from your favourite rice dumpling spot. If the rice dumplings are not eaten on the day of purchase, they should be placed in the refrigerator where they can be usually kept for up to four days. When you&#8217;re ready to tuck in, reheat the rice dumplings by steaming for 15 minutes or boiling for 12 minutes.</p>

<p>The recipe for rice dumplings from Eastern Rice Dumpling has been passed down three generations for the last 40 years.

Their popular rice dumplings include Nyonya Dumpling and the Hokkien Rice Dumpling made from fried glutinous rice and a filling of chestnut, mushroom and pork marinated with five spices.</p>

Over here, kids can dive into a foam pit and ball pit, and bounce around on trampolines. There are also a fair share of slides they can whizz down, and plenty of swings. Little ones can grab a kiddy car to zoom around the race car track, and those with lots of energy have plenty of structures to climb.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Looking to give your teen a head start in university? Learn how the Advanced Placement (AP) Programme can set them up for academic success to thrive in university and beyond.</h2>
<p>Applying to international universities can be highly competitive, and giving your child a strong academic foundation could be the key to standing out. If you’ve been wondering how to help your child stand out, the AP Programme might be just what they need! But what exactly is the AP Programme, and how does it compare to options like the IB?</p>
<p>We break down what the AP Programme is all about, and how <a href="https://www.ics.edu.sg/academics/high-school/advanced-placement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Community School&#8217;s (ICS)</a> AP Programme equips students with the critical thinking, time management, and academic confidence they need to shine in competitive international applications.</p>
<h2>Is the AP Programme a better fit for my child?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-229002 aligncenter" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ICS.jpg" alt="ICS" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ICS.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ICS-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ICS-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>Got a teen excelling in certain subjects and eager to explore them further? The AP Programme offers the perfect opportunity! Students can choose courses that align with their interests and goals, challenging themselves while developing critical thinking skills. Students also get to earn college credits along the way, giving them a head start in their university journey while saving both time and money on their degree.</p>
<p>Although the courses in the AP Programme are more college-level compared to those in the <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/ib-schools-international-baccalaureate-singapore/">IB Programme</a>, the amount of credit awarded varies by university and course. On the other hand, students in the more holistic IB Programme are awarded credits for high scores in Higher Level (HL) exams, with the threshold often set at a score of 5 or higher. The AP Programme is subject-specific, allowing students to choose individual courses and earn credits based on the number of AP exams taken and their scores.</p>
<p>The AP Programme gives students more flexibility, allowing them to focus on subjects they’re interested in or need for specific university requirements, giving them a smoother transition into university life. Plus, AP courses are designed to match college-level content, pace, and exams, helping students prep for what’s ahead.</p>
<h2>How the AP Programme at ICS sets students up for success</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-228489 aligncenter" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/international-community-school-sportsa.jpg" alt="ICS" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/international-community-school-sportsa.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/international-community-school-sportsa-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/international-community-school-sportsa-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>At ICS, students can choose from over 20 AP courses across STEM, business, humanities, and the arts. To keep students on track, teachers assign summer work to kickstart the year and use tools like the College Board’s AP Classroom, progress checks, and past exam questions. Regular feedback, small group sessions, and extra support during lunch or after school are also part of the well-rounded approach that ICS takes to ensure students stay ahead. At ICS, AP students have achieved an impressive average score of 4.2 out of 5, earning placements in top universities worldwide, including those in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Europe, and Australia!</p>
<p>Courses here challenge students to analyse, synthesise, and communicate complex ideas and then nurture them into independent learners and effective time managers. Some of the high-achieving courses at ICS, known for strong performance both in exam results and student engagement, include AP Psychology, AP Calculus, and AP English Literature. Students also receive personalised guidance from counsellors to help them choose the right courses that align with their academic goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="entry-title">We encourage families to think of ways, big and small, to say thank you to your helper this May during Helper Appreciation Month.</h2>
<p>May is Helper Appreciation Month in Singapore. This celebration of helpers in Singapore is something we at Sassy Mama fully support. The idea for celebrating helpers throughout the month of May began in Hong Kong, where resident Steve Chitty pointed out the month is a natural fit given that it encompasses Labour Day, <a class="c-link" tabindex="-1" href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/family-life-mothers-day-helper-leave-children-work-abroad-novia-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.sassymamasg.com/family-life-mothers-day-helper-leave-children-work-abroad-novia-home/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">Mother’s Day</a> and the International Day of Families. Since we began with a one-day celebration and awards ceremony in 2016 to say thank you to helpers and recognise all the amazing ways they support our families, the celebration evolved from large events to show helpers how much we appreciate them to small gestures like holding giveaways.</p>

<p>Help your helper have fun on her day off with our roundup of clubs, hobbies, and activities for helpers in Singapore!</p>
<p>The struggle to achieve a work/life balance is real for all of us! But when you work 6 days a week (and <em>live at your workplace</em>) it can be even tougher. Making time for fun can make a big difference to the rest of the week, whether it’s getting some exercise, indulging a creative side, joining a club or getting together with friends. Make sure your helper knows what’s on offer for her in her spare time and on her day off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Check out these kid-friendly places for rock climbing and bouldering in Singapore.</h2>
<p>Want to take the kids rock climbing or bouldering in Singapore? Rock climbing is such a fun physical <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-101-things-to-do-with-kids-singapore/">family-friendly activity</a> and it&#8217;s a great way for kids to <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-17-games-kids-moving-fine-motor-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">develop gross motor skills</a> and build stamina. Need a few recommendations for bouldering (which is a form of climbing without ropes) or kids&#8217; rock climbing? We round up a few cool spots with themed climbing walls, augmented reality areas and more! Loads of these rock climbing and bouldering gyms are also open for younger kiddos – some even host <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-kids-birthday-party-singapore-venues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">birthday parties</a>. All you have to do is come in sportswear and bring covered sports shoes with socks. You can rent special climbing shoes if needed, along with any other necessary equipment, from the rock climbing or bouldering gyms directly. Do note that you&#8217;ll need to check minimum age/weight requirement,s and you have to factor in rental on top of rock climbing entry fees. Keep scrolling to find out all the best rock climbing and bouldering gyms in Singapore!</p>
<p><strong>Difference between Bouldering and Rock Climbing:</strong></p>
<p>Bouldering is a type of rock climbing that doesn’t require a rope or harness. Bouldering walls are thus not very high since you only climb 3-5 metres. There will usually be a soft landing pad under a bouldering wall for you to land on if you fall. You&#8217;ll need to learn the correct bouldering techniques and how to return to the floor safely. Rock climbing (also called rope climbing) requires a rope and harness, and you frequently climb more than 9 metres off the ground. With rock climbing, many centres use an auto belay &#8211; an automatic electro-mechanical or mechanical climbing belay system. It replaces the need for someone to hold your rope and tighten it as you climb, as the auto-belay automatically retracts the climbing rope, taking up the slack as you climb. Kids can easily learn how to do this, but for safety, you should check that new climbers are locked in every time they climb. With bouldering, no such equipment is needed. Our kids have found rock climbing more fun as many of the climbing walls are themed, and they like the challenge of climbing high, which you don&#8217;t get with bouldering. Also, with bouldering, to come down from your climb, you need to jump to the crash pad. With rock climbing, kids get to rappel (abseil) back down safely with the auto-belay system, which is pretty fun!</p>

<p>Outpost Climbing (previously called T-Hall) is a family-friendly indoor rock climbing and bouldering gym in Singapore with two zones. It&#8217;s probably our favourite rock-climbing spot in Singapore. Start at the Fun Zone if you are new to rock climbing or have kids. This rock climbing area has a cutting-edge augmented climbing wall, which uses motion-sensing tech to transform into various games where you&#8217;ll climb up, down and even sideways. There are fun-themed rock climbing walls that kids will love, from a Lego Wall to a Rubik&#8217;s Cube wall and even a glow-in-the-dark wall inside a dark tunnel! Kids as young as 4 years old (with a minimum weight of 15 kgs) can learn to climb her,e and you&#8217;ll get a safety briefing to learn how to use the auto-belay system before you can proceed to the rock climbing walls. The Climb Zone in a separate room is its own rock climbing and bouldering centre in itself! This huge rock climbing and bouldering space (the biggest we have seen in Singapore) lets you build your bouldering techniques, and also offers various certification programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Outpost Climbing rock climbing prices:</strong> Entry to the Fun Zone is from $28 (with a $10 add-on for accompanying non-climbing adults), and this includes rock climbing equipment. The Climb Zone rates start from $18 for youths &amp; $28 for adults with rock climbing equipment rental on top.</p>

<p>If you thought the Museum of Ice Cream was all about eating ice cream, you’re not too far off. Ticket holders will get to enjoy ice cream treats (by names such as Denzy Gelato and Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s, with vegan and allergen-friendly options) as they are guided through the 60- to 90-minute experience by the Museum of Ice Cream staff.</p>
<p>And when we say ice cream treats, we mean unlimited servings of ice cream! There are 19 flavours and eight toppings to choose from, including favourites such as Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough and Strawberry Speculoos. There are also other cool treats such as ice cream sandwiches, ice cream tacos and more.</p>

<p>One of the highlights at the Museum of Ice Cream is the fully functional, Singapore-inspired “Dragon Playground” that&#8217;s actually a unicorn design with an area to climb up and a small slide to whizz down. There are banana swings and some basketball hoops to shoot while you are there.</p>
<p>The whole place is designed for lots of posing for Instagram &#8211; it&#8217;s pink, pink and more pink. Look out for the red, orange, pink and yellow wall of 10,000 bananas that leads to a craft area for kids to make a little pink ice cream truck out of paper.</p>

<h2>So are tickets to the Museum of Ice Cream worth it?</h2>
<figure id="attachment_171254" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171254" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-171254 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_3692.jpg" alt="museum of ice cream MOIC" width="720" height="561" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_3692.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_3692-300x234.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_3692-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-171254" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Beate Baldry</figcaption></figure>
<p>We asked our two kiddos if they liked the experience. They said it was 10 out of 10. Unlimited ice cream will do that to kids. We found the price a little steep, but rest assured the kids will have a ball of a time especially if you&#8217;re out of ideas of <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-101-things-to-do-with-kids-singapore/">what to do with the kids</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Stuttering, speech delays, articulation struggles &#8211; sound familiar? Here’s how to spot the signs your child might need speech therapy, and how the therapists at Ray of Joy Therapy can help!</h2>
<p>Parents, are you noticing that your child is not meeting certain communication milestones or seems to be falling behind their peers? Whether they’re struggling with speech delay, having trouble engaging in conversations or finding it hard to pronounce words, these challenges can impact their confidence.</p>
<p>But here’s the good news–early intervention can make all the difference! Here are some signs that your child might need speech therapy, and how the MOE-experienced therapists at Ray of Joy Therapy can help.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Read more: <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-special-needs-school-singapore-preschools-early-intervention-therapy-centres-international-schools/">Guide to SPED Schools, Early Intervention Centres, Inclusive &amp; Special Needs Schools in Singapore</a><br />
</em></p>
<h2>Common signs that your child may need speech therapy</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-228364" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ray-of-joy-therapy-speech-therapists.jpeg" alt="ray of joy therapy" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ray-of-joy-therapy-speech-therapists.jpeg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ray-of-joy-therapy-speech-therapists-300x233.jpeg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ray-of-joy-therapy-speech-therapists-100x78.jpeg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>Communication challenges can impact your child in the long run, but how can you tell if they need professional help? While it’s important to keep in mind that children develop at their own pace, certain signs may indicate the need for early intervention.</p>
<p>One of the most common challenges is speech delay. You might notice your child falling behind their peers when it comes to speaking or understanding language. Some children also face difficulty forming complete sentences or using incomplete phrases. Most kids begin speaking around 1 year old and start forming sentences by 2. If your child isn’t hitting these milestones, it might be a good idea to seek support.</p>
<p>Other common signs to look out for include trouble following instructions, struggling with articulation, unintelligible speech and stuttering. Parents should also observe if their child has difficulty maintaining conversations, making friends or understanding social cues, which may be accompanied by frustration when trying to communicate.</p>
<h2>Why early detection is important</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-228373 aligncenter" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ray-of-joy-therapy-space.jpg" alt="ray of joy therapy" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ray-of-joy-therapy-space.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ray-of-joy-therapy-space-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ray-of-joy-therapy-space-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>Communication challenges can impact your child in the long run, making it harder for them to build self-confidence, make friends, express their feelings and even succeed in school.  Early intervention is essential in helping your child communicate effectively, which in turn supports their emotional and social development.</p>
<p>Speech therapists are beneficial at addressing these challenges and ensuring your child gets the support they need. At Ray of Joy Therapy, the team, made out of three founders, brings extensive MOE school and preschool experience, offering unique insights into the communication skills children need. Therapy sessions can be held at their One Holland Village space or at your home. These sessions are designed to help parents understand how communication skills impact children at every educational stage &#8211; from playground interactions to classroom participation &#8211; providing therapy that prepares children for real-world communication challenges.</p>

<h2>Looking for an inclusive or SPED school, early intervention centre or special needs school in Singapore? Consult our list to find the right one for your child.</h2>
<p>Special education schools in Singapore (SPED) are part of a quickly evolving landscape, as 2019 marked the first year that Singaporean students with moderate-to-severe special needs were required to attend school under the government’s Compulsory Education <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/compulsory-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">framework</a>. These days, younger learners and non-Singaporean students also have plenty of options for special education <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-best-preschools-in-singapore/">preschools</a> and early intervention centres that can help differently-abled children thrive in supportive and safe environments – Singapore has 19 government-funded SPED schools, too, which you can <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/special-educational-needs/sped-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view here</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside special education schools, inclusive schools, which are &#8216;mainstream schools&#8217; where diverse students learn side by side in the same classroom with extra support offered, there is a notable culture shift towards <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-neurodiversity-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurodivergent acceptance and inclusion</a>.</p>
<p>Do note that there is some controversy around applied behaviour analysis (ABA) therapy to &#8216;fix&#8217; autistic attributes and teach autistic kids skills to lessen problematic behaviour like self-harm. Some parents and the neurodiversity movement do not support the use of ABA therapy and instead seek out interventions that use <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-neurodiversity-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurodiverse-affirming approaches</a>. As always, do your research to understand what therapy you feel would best suit your child. <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-neurodiversity-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We discuss the different approaches here. </a></p>
<p>Wondering where to find a SPED school, inclusive<a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-best-preschools-in-singapore/"> preschool</a> or an early intervention programme that will suit your child&#8217;s learning needs? We&#8217;ve rounded up a wide range of special needs schools in Singapore – from inclusive schools to specialist special needs <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-best-preschools-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preschools</a> and early prevention programmes – which cater to Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and non-Singaporean students of differing abilities unless stated otherwise.

<p>Melbourne International School is a small inclusive school that caters to students aged 3 to 12 years old. They offer a nurturing and supportive learning environment where each student feels psychologically safe, heard and accepted, tailoring their lessons to each student&#8217;s unique needs and learning pace. The Early Years and Years 1 to 5 programmes are inclusive mainstream programmes, but they also offer an alternative route for students who are better suited for the special education programme. All programmes include collaborative therapy with a speech therapist, occupational therapist and psychology professionals.</p>
<p>Parents love their small class ratio of 1 teacher to 4 to 8 students, ensuring that each student gets personalised attention to reach their fullest potential. Students are better able to focus, providing a conducive and comfortable learning environment for all. Since one size does not fit all, their educators adopt a differentiated and multi-sensory approach to teaching. In addition to a team of therapists, the educators also collaborate with specialist teachers in music and art to further enhance their teaching skills.</p>
<p>A testament to the integrity of their programmes, Melbourne International School is a recipient of the WASC accreditation. This recognition assures parents that their curriculum is appropriate and executed through robust education programmes, reinforcing their mission to provide equal educational opportunities to all neurodivergent learners.</p>

<h2>Frequently Used Terms for Special Needs Learning in Singapore</h2>
<p>We strongly suggest checking out Singapore’s Association for Persons with Special Needs (<a href="http://www.apsn.org.sg/">APSN)</a> and the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/special-educational-needs/resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M.O.E.’s</a> <em><a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/special-educational-needs/resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parent’s Guide for Children </a>with Special Education Needs</em>, which answers the question “<em>What does it mean to have special education needs?” </em>with the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have been diagnosed with a disability</li>
<li>They show greater difficulty in learning as compared to the majority of their peers of the same age (e.g. difficulties in social, language, academic or physical abilities).</li>
<li>They require different or additional resources beyond what is generally available for the majority of their peers of the same age.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA)<br />
</strong>Commonly practised as a therapeutic intervention for Autism, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/applied-behavior-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABA is a type of therapy</a> that focuses on improving specific behaviours, such as social skills, communication, reading and academics, as well as adaptive learning skills. Do note that there is some controversy around applied behaviour analysis (ABA) therapy to &#8216;fix&#8217; autistic attributes and teach autistic kids skills to lessen problematic behaviour like self-harm. Some parents and the neurodiversity movement do not support the use of ABA therapy and instead seek out interventions that use <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-neurodiversity-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurodiverse-affirming approaches</a>. <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/learn-neurodiversity-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We discuss the different approaches. here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autism spectrum disorder</a> (or just autism) is a broad range of conditions characterised by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviours, speech and nonverbal communication.</p>
<p><strong>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A brain disorder</a> marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Early Intervention<br />
</strong>In Singapore, early intervention programmes are defined as seeking to equip infants and young children with special needs with improved motor, communication, social, self-help and cognitive skills. Early intervention activities are designed to maximise their developmental growth potential and minimise the development of secondary disabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusive education<br />
</strong>This is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_(education)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">educational model or philosophy</a> where special needs students are in the same classroom as non-special-needs (general education) students, with the belief that it fosters understanding and tolerance and better prepares students of all abilities to function in the world beyond school.</p>
<p><strong>Mainstream school<br />
</strong>“<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/search?q=special%20education%20in%20mainstream%20schools&amp;app=site_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mainstreaming</a>” is the practice of placing students with special education needs in a general education classroom during certain times, based on their skills (while at others placing them in separate special education classes). This is in contrast to “inclusion”.</p>
<p><strong>Neurotypical<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/neurotypical" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A relatively new term used to describe individuals of “typical” developmental, intellectual and cognitive abilities</a> (in contrast to someone who may be on the autism spectrum or has other developmental differences characterising them as “neurodiverse”).</p>
<p><strong>Occupational Therapists<br />
</strong><a href="https://saot.org.sg/about-ot/what-is-occupational-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">These specialists</a> can help children achieve developmental milestones such as fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. In a broader sense, occupational therapists work with people to help make everyday living easier.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow teachers<br />
</strong>Shadow teachers work directly with a single special needs student in a mainstream <em>or </em>inclusive educational setting, focusing on social development and any particular difficulties that might arise from a child’s specific abilities</p>
<p><strong>Speech Therapists<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.nuhs.edu.sg/careers/nuhs-allied-health-professionals/speech-therapist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speech therapists</a> work with people of all ages with communication or swallowing difficulties, including comprehension and expression, articulation and phonology, fluency, and voice. Speech therapists can also help kids with other issues with spoken and written language, including dyslexia, dyspraxia, and auditory processing disorder.</p>

<p>What makes Da Nang such an appealing holiday destination for travellers from Singapore is its relatively close proximity. We love that there are direct flights from Singapore to Da Nang available daily. Flights from Singapore to Da Nang are about 2 hours and 45 minutes long on Singapore Airlines and Vietjet, no transits needed. The flights aren’t too lengthy which is a bonus if you’re travelling with young children.</p>

<p>The best time to visit Da Nang is between January and August. The dry season in Da Nang lasts from February to May and is perfect for outdoor activities with daytime temperatures averaging between 25°C to 30°C. We love that the evenings are cool with low humidity during this time, unlike the tropical weather we’re used to in Singapore.</p>
<p>The hottest months in Da Nang are between June and August, with temperatures hitting 40°C. The rainy season in Da Nang starts from around September and lasts till December/January. During this time temperatures will drop to around 18°C to 23°C, with the city being susceptible to typhoons.</p>

<p>They say Da Nang is the “Miami of Vietnam” and it’s because of its gorgeous white sand beaches, and that’s without a doubt thanks to the acclaimed My Khe Beach. My Khe Beach has earned a reputation as one of the best things to do in Da Nang for its powdery sand, rows of palm trees, calm waves and picturesque view of the mountains and open sea. Stretching a whopping 10 kilometres long, My Khe Beach is a great place to go with the family in Da Nang for sunbathing, sunrise and sunset, beach sports and water sports.</p>

<p>Giant rock hands, a cable car, a French village, an alpine coaster ride, a fantasy park and more: there’s so much to do a Ba Na Hills in Da Nang with the kids! Ba Na Hills is located about an hour’s drive from Da Nang city, or 20 minutes if you head to the Hoi An cable car station near Ba Na Hills SunWorld and take the gondola up. That said, you’ll want to set aside at least half a day to cover all the best things to do at Ba Na Hills.</p>
<p>First up is the famous Golden Bridge; you know–that iconic bridge held up by two massive rock hands. We recommend taking the cable car up to enjoy stunning views of the valley below. The Golden Bridge is located near the Marseille cable car station. It gets busy with tourists, so we recommend heading here as early as possible.</p>
<p>You can then take the cable car to other parts of Ba Na Hills. A must-visit is the French village at Morin Station, and we guarantee the kids will love Fantasy Park Da Nang, which has a natural history museum with dinosaurs and arcade games–all included in the cost of your Ba Na Hills entry ticket. There’s also the Alpine Coasters ride and picturesque gardens up here. There are hotels at Ba Na Hills if you wish to stay the night, but honestly, a day trip here is sufficient.</p>

<p>The perfect spot for enjoying Da Nang’s stunning natural beauty, Marble Mountains Da Nang comprises five limestone peaks and is adorned with Buddhist religious sites. Over here, you’ll find caves and trails, as well as towers and pagodas that date all the way back to the 17th century. All these are accented by overgrown vines and moss and marble statues that give the mountain its ancient city vibe. At the foothills of the mountain, you’ll find numerous marble shops and stalls selling souvenirs and trinkets.</p>
<p>Just be warned: you’ll have to climb a lot of stairs. We don’t recommend bringing young kids here as it’s not stroller-friendly at all, and some of the trails are very rugged and with slippery rocks. Older kids should be able to tackle the mountains, though–they can even climb through a cave! Trust us, the amazing sights of Marble Mountains are what make it one of the best things to do in Da Nang.</p>

<p>The Dragon Bridge in Da Nang is pretty hard to miss as you can see it en route from the airport to My Khe Beach. The bridge isn’t just a cool monument of the city; it’s also where you can catch the FREE fire and water show! This one’s not to be missed, because the Dragon Bridge in Da Nang actually breathes fire! The dragon fire-breathing show starts at 9pm and is about 15 minutes long. You can view it from the shores of the Han River or from the parallel Tran Thi Ly Bridge.</p>

<p>With an inflatable water playground, a massive swimming pool, a well-equipped kids club, kids activities and more, Hyatt Regency Danang Resort and Spa is easily one of the most kid-friendly hotels in Da Nang. This beachfront resort is undoubtedly luxurious with rooms, suites and villas to choose from, as well as the exclusive VIE Spa, complimentary wellness activities (sound baths, yoga and more!) and world-class on-site dining options (Le Petit Chef, themed nights with BBQ dinners and more).</p>
<p>However, the show-stopper here is really the kid-friendly facilities. Over at the Camp Hyatt kids club, kids can let loose at the small indoor playground with a ball pit, lots of toys and two bouncy castles. We love that there are complimentary kids’ activities and workshops throughout the day, so you can drop the kids off and then go relax at the spa. There’s a massive playground next to the kids’ club, as well as the kids’ pool with an inflatable water playground. You’ll also find an array of fun lawn games, a rock-climbing wall and a small football field here.</p>
<p>The resort also has a gaming arcade that’s free to use for all guests plus a vegetable garden with a rabbit coop! Kids will also love frolicking on the spacious white sand beach and you can easily tire them out just at the humongous main swimming pool (which also has a little ‘faux beach’ corner) alone.</p>

<p>A popular addition to any Da Nang itinerary is a day trip to Hoi An. There are plenty of things to do in Hoi An with the kids.

Visitors flock here to witness the Hoi An Lantern Festival which takes place on the 14th day of each lunar month.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to stay in Hoi An, you’ll want to bring the kids to the Hoi An Impression Theme Park. Each night there’s the magnificent Memories Show, which features over 500 performers, dazzling lights and special effects that tell a story of Hoi An’s 400-year history. You can also check out the Hoi An Night Market for great street food in Hoi An.

<p>Beyond learning in the classroom, children can choose from a range of enriching co-curricular activities to discover and develop their passions like art, sports and music.

<p>Australian International School is proud of its global community which comprises over 50 nationalities, teaching children to appreciate diversity from a young age. By growing up with people from different cultures, children develop empathy, open-mindedness and cultural awareness, equipping them to thrive in an interconnected world.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, &#8220;It takes a village to raise a child.&#8221; That&#8217;s why the school is intentional about creating opportunities for connection, encouraging frequent collaboration between parents and educators. Parents receive weekly newsletters and daily updates from the StoryPark platform. They also have an on-site Parent Café, where you can grab a cuppa or an afternoon snack with fellow parents before picking the kids up from school.</p>
<p>The Early Learning Village at Australian International School is ready to equip your child with the skills, confidence and curiosity they need to succeed. <a href="https://www.ais.com.sg/book-a-tour/?utm_source=sassymama&amp;utm_medium=advertorial&amp;utm_campaign=bookatour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Book a tour today</a> to get a sneak peek into a day in the life of a young learner at Australian International School&#8217;s Early Learning Village!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Children&#8217;s book recommendations for according to kids&#8217; ages&#8211;for reluctant and insatiable readers alike!</h2>
<p>Every literary expert will tell you: the first step to <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/raising-readers-favourite-books-for-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting your child to love books</a> is to <em>read, read and read</em> some more. And to do that, you’ve got to find the right books to pique their interest. So, if you’re running out of ideas, we’ve come up with a list of recommended children&#8217;s books based on what they already know and love. It’s important to note that each child reads at their own pace and will differ in maturity level, so the age ranges we have included are more of a guide rather than set age restrictions. Some may find these suggestions too advanced or not challenging enough, so we’ll leave it to you<em> (and your kids!)</em> to decide what you think is the most appropriate page-turner for your little bookworm.</p>
<p>Here are our favourite book recommendations by age:</p>
<p><a href="#4to7">4 to 7 years old</a><br />
<a href="#8to11">8 to 11 years old</a><br />
<a href="#12to14">12 to 14 years old</a><br />
<a href="#14AndOlder">14 and older</a></p>
<h2 id="4to7">4 to 7 years old</h2>
<p><strong>If they like Peppa Pig&#8230; try <em>Charlie and Lola</em> by Lauren Child</strong></p>
<p>A natural progression from many a parent’s saviour, Peppa Pig, is <em>Charlie and Lola</em> by Lauren Child. Before the cartoon there were the books, and there’s plenty to choose from with 38 titles including <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2TFjChw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Will Never Eat That Tomato</a> </em>and <a href="https://amzn.to/2ClCYh2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>I Am Too Absolutely Small to Go to School</em></a>. This series is particularly great if your child has a younger sibling, as Charlie is a picture-perfect, patient, big brother to Lola and her curious and crazy ways.</p>
<p><strong>If they like <em>One Gorilla</em> by Anthony Browne&#8230; try <em>Chu</em> by Neil Gaiman</strong></p>
<p>Who doesn’t love pandas? Neil Gaiman writes for all ages – the very young, teens and adults – but we’re big fans of his series about everyone’s favourite panda, Chu. Chu’s charming adventures would be an excellent addition to your picture book collection because he’s just so incredibly cute <em>(we can’t even)</em>. This series is ideal for little readers, as the books aren’t too long and the delightful artwork really helps bring the stories to life for parents and children alike. If Chu isn’t already your child’s best friend, he sure will be soon.<em> <a href="https://amzn.to/2HCTbly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find the series at Amazon</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>If they like <em>We’re Going On A Bear Hunt</em> by Michael Rosen try&#8230; his whole catalogue</strong></p>
<p>Not only does Michael Rosen create timeless, family-focused stories perfect for reading out loud, he’s also an author that really knows what little ones love to read. That’s why we’re recommending his full back catalogue. He was previously the British Children’s Laureate and a professor in children’s literature – not that this means anything to kids, mind you. But children with a cheeky streak will love his <a href="https://amzn.to/2Od5yWt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Little Rabbit Foo Foo</em></a> in particular and her meddling ways in this cute poetic story which you can even sing along to. <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2ObGa3m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> to see his full author page on Amazon!</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="8to11">8 to 11 years old</h2>
<p><strong>If they like <em>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em> by Jeff Kinney&#8230; try <em>Hank Zipzer</em> by Henry Winkler</strong></p>
<p>Jeff Kinney’s <em>Diary Of A Wimpy Kid</em> has been a revelation in getting kids to read <em>(especially boys!).</em> This series tells the tale of Greg Heffley’s hilarious school fails as he tries to navigate being a slightly awkward middle schooler <em>(ah, takes you back to your own school years, right?)</em>. If your kid loves these books, and they probably already do, then we suggest Henry Winkler’s <em>(yes, the Fonz!)</em> <a href="https://amzn.to/2TLMOn6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hank Zipzer series</a>. Hank is everyone’s favourite anti-hero, struggling at school due to his learning difficulties but still trying his best to get by. Winkler himself has struggled with his own dyslexia and wanted to reflect this in his books – they’re even formatted in an easy-to-read typeface. This is a great series to give a confidence boost to any young reader struggling with their own obstacles and teaches empathy and understanding to the rest. <em>Available from Book Depository <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Young-Hank-Zipzer-1-Bookmarks-Are-People-Too-Henry-Winkler/9781406361377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></em></p>
<p><strong>If they like Roald Dahl&#8230; try <em>Gangsta Granny</em> by David Walliams</strong></p>
<p>David Walliams seems to have taken his place as the modern-day Roald Dahl. His books are even illustrated by Quentin Blake, the man behind all of the classic Dahl covers you loved as a kid. Cheeky, irreverent and wildly funny <em>(even for adults!),</em> <em>Gangsta Granny</em> &#8211; along with Walliams&#8217; many other titles &#8211; will have your kids rolling on the floor with laughter. The gangsta granny in question is deemed the “boringest” grandma in the world, until our curious protagonist, Ben, discovers she’s actually an international jewel thief <em>(didn’t expect that, did ya?)</em> and she’s after the crown jewels&#8230; <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Oc1tSD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find it here on Amazon</a>. </em></p>
<p><strong>If they’re into James Bond-esque thrillers&#8230; try <em>Artemis Fowl</em> by Eoin Colfer</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2CpcFGJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Artemis Fowl series</a> by Eoin Colfer has everything an action-loving reader needs. The title character is a 12-year-old millionaire, criminal, and mastermind who decides to takes on the race of fairies to steal all their gold. Keeping up? This series is so entertaining, we think it’s the perfect choice for parents to read with their children <em>(reading together doesn’t have to stop once they’re too big for your lap!)</em>. We particularly love this series as it’s a brilliant introduction to more sophisticated storytelling. The dialogue is witty and Artemis is a whip-smart, complicated fellow – the definition of an antihero. So you’ll be able to have some epic discussions together about Artemis’ slightly skewed inner moral compass. <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Y3vpVz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> to see Book 1 on Amazon!</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="12to14">12 to 14 years old</h2>
<p><strong>If they like <em>Girl Online</em> by Zoe Sugg&#8230; try <em>Geek Girl</em> by Holly Smale</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2HAqyp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holly Smale’s &#8220;Geek Girl&#8221; series</a> revolves around the proudly nerdy Natasha. She is trying to survive her secondary school years with a limited social circle, while battling a nasty bully intent on making her life a living hell. That is, until she’s discovered by a modelling talent agency and her life is thrown into a whirlwind of fashion shows and international travel. This is an awesome series for girls trying to find their way; it teaches that it’s okay to be a geek and it’s okay to be a chic fashionista, just as long as you stay true to yourself <em>(cheesy we know – but an important lesson all the same)</em>. Available from Book Depository <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Geek-Girl-Holly-Smale/9780007489442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If they like <em>Skulduggery Pleasant</em> by Derek Landy&#8230; try Garth Nix&#8217;s catalogue</strong></p>
<p>In a past life, when I worked as a librarian<em> (no jokes about cat hair and cardigans please!)</em> Skulduggery Pleasant, the wise-cracking skeleton detective was always in high demand, especially with boys. Now in its 11<sup>th</sup> reincarnation, it’s dark, witty and full of spine-tingling mystery and action. So, if you have an avid reader looking for what’s next after the adventures of Skulduggery, we recommend the works of Garth Nix. There’s the <a href="https://amzn.to/2UIb71Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Troubletwisters&#8221; series</a> about two twins discovering their supernatural powers, which is better suited for the lower end of this age range. And for the older kids, there’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2UJurvy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;The Abhorsen&#8221; series</a>. Nix writes magical, dark and dramatic stories that often focus profoundly on death. There are themes of sex and drinking featured in this series, so we suggest you read them beforehand to see if they are age-appropriate for your kids. Available from Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>If they like <em>The Hunger Games</em> by Suzanne Collins&#8230; try <em>The Knife Of Never Letting Go</em> by Patrick Ness</strong></p>
<p>Patrick’s Ness’ dark dystopia <em>The Knife of Never Letting Go</em> begins in a small town where women have been banished and only men remain <em>(the horror!).</em> Due to a virus, everyone can hear each other’s thoughts, an epidemic known as the “Noise”. This is the first in a thrilling sci-fi series that tackles big questions, much like &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221;, such as identity and prejudice. Available from Book Depository <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Knife-Never-Letting-Go-Patrick-Ness/9781406357981" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="14AndOlder">14 and older</h2>
<p><strong>Parent Tip:</strong> We’re now entering the YA <em>(young adult)</em> genre, which can vary widely in themes, content and levels of maturity, so do your due diligence if you feel uncomfortable with your teen or tween reading beyond their age or about certain topics.</p>
<p><strong>If they like <em>The Fault In Our Stars</em> by John Green&#8230; try Sarah Desson&#8217;s catalogue</strong></p>
<p>Even the most casual reader knows of John Green’s sob-fest <em>The Fault In Our Stars</em>, so if they loved the thoughtful tone of Green’s teen mega-hit, look for anything by Sarah Desson. We particularly recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2W4vQNB" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Just Listen</em></a>, which is about Annabel, the girl who had everything and then quickly lost it all. The book details how she deals with her new social status<em> (or lack thereof)</em>, her sister’s anorexia and the new mysterious guy in her class. It’s a thoughtful and sometimes sad read, tackling mental illness and the importance of family, listening to each other and the healing power of music.</p>
<p><strong>If they like <em>Noughts and Crosses</em> by Malorie Blackman&#8230; try <em>The Hate U Give</em> by Angie Thomas</strong></p>
<p>This book has won multiple awards and certainly packs a punch as it depicts modern-day race relations in the United States. The main protagonist, Starr, witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend, Khalil, at the hands of a police officer and struggles to know where to turn next as the ensuing media circus and debate boils over. Big themes and even bigger discussion points here, so don’t be surprised if your teen goes quiet while reading this one — there’s a lot to mull over. <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2OblN6L" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find it on Amazon</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>If they like <em>The Maze Runner</em> by James Dashner&#8230; try <em>Gone</em> by Michael Grant</strong></p>
<p>A lot of YA fiction is targeted at girls and focuses on romance, so we wanted to recommend something for boys who might be reluctant readers. <a href="https://amzn.to/2Y3PmLR" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Gone</em></a> is certainly a page-turner and a half, similar to a Stephen King mystery with added sci-fi fantasy. In this dystopia, everyone disappears, except the young, which might sound like a dream to your teen, but with no technology <em>(no phones?!),</em> the threat of hunger, and no adults to guide them, tensions rise and a new world of territorial, supernatural teens arises.</p>
<p><strong>Parent Tip: </strong>If you’re wanting to avoid online shopping and you can’t find a particular title in-store or at your <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/best-libraries-for-kids-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local library</a>, then ask! Often, shops and libraries are willing to order in books but this can sometimes come with an extra cost. Check out <a href="https://www.hkpl.gov.hk/en/locations/libraries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list</a> of libraries in Hong Kong to find your nearest book-borrowing service.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Coney Island was previously known as Pulau Serangoon or Serangoon Island, and the capacious 50-hectares island is also an ecologically sustainable park. Coney island was previously owned by the Haw Par brothers before it was sold to Ghulam Mahmood, an Indian businessman, in the 1950s. Mr Mahmood had intended to re-create the famous Coney Island of New York here but that dream was short-lived. In the 1970s, Coney Island was returned to the Singapore government and today the quiet park ironically retains the name of a famously busy amusement park.</p>
<p>Coney Island in Singapore has plenty of rustic charm, home to a wide variety of habitats and a diverse range of fauna and flora, including several nationally threatened species. The park is favoured by more than 80 species of birds, offering visitors an ideal location for birdwatching. Explore the forest and mangrove habitats on foot or by bicycle. Be charmed by five differently themed beach areas and a variety of habitats that support beautiful free-flowering plants and critically endangered species.</p>
<p><strong>Things To Do At Coney Island: Cycling, Birdwatching &amp; More:</strong></p>
<h3>1. Cycling at Coney Island Park: Bicycle rental at Coney Island</h3>
<figure id="attachment_173974" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173974" style="width: 716px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-173974 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/coney-island-park.jpeg" alt="cycling Coney Island Park singapore" width="716" height="564" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/coney-island-park.jpeg 716w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/coney-island-park-300x236.jpeg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/coney-island-park-100x79.jpeg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-173974" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Abigail Wright</figcaption></figure>
<p>With views that are off the beaten path, Coney Island makes for a great cycling day out! You can bring your own bikes or easily rent a bicycle at Coney Island. Once you&#8217;ve arrived at Punggol Settlement, look out for Go Cycling (find them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoCyclingSG">here</a>), which is in the opposite direction from Coney Island, or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JomandoAdventureNRecreation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jomando Adventure and Recreations</a>, which is nearer (about 200m away) to the park&#8217;s West entrance. Choose from mountain bikes, cutesy city bikes (perfect for mini photo shoots with the fam) and even bikes with trolleys just in case you&#8217;ve brought extra necessities for a family day out.</p>
<p>Do note that there are mixed paths at Coney Island Park&#8211;some are easier to cycle on than others. If your family are keen cyclists, you can tack on a ride along the <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/punggol-waterway-park-sassy-mama-field-trip/" target="_blank" rel="follow index noopener">Punggol Park Connector</a> before or after your Coney Island trip. The cycle route around the Punggol promenade is relatively short compared to other bike ride options in Singapore, as it only spans 4.2km, but it’s a really leisurely ride with great views of nature and the manmade waterway.</p>

<h3>2. Bird-watch at Coney Island</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-173966 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/coney-island-park-bird-watching-collared-kingfisher.jpg" alt="Coney Island Guide - cycling at coney island - wildlife at coney island - bird watching" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/coney-island-park-bird-watching-collared-kingfisher.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/coney-island-park-bird-watching-collared-kingfisher-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/coney-island-park-bird-watching-collared-kingfisher-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>There are over 80 species of birds on the island, so if you love to look out for kingfishers and more <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wild-animals-singapore-crocodiles-dolphins-otters/">wildlife in Singapore</a>, wait around at the bird-watching hideout. This spot on Coney Island allows you to observe the birds in their natural environment without scaring them away. Tip: tell the kids to keep their voices hushed, else the birds will stay away!</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Explore the Coney Island beaches</h3>
<figure id="attachment_177722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177722" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-177722 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Singapore-beaches-coney-island-punggol-with-Singapore-beaches.png" alt="Singapore beaches coney island punggol with Singapore beaches" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Singapore-beaches-coney-island-punggol-with-Singapore-beaches.png 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Singapore-beaches-coney-island-punggol-with-Singapore-beaches-300x233.png 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Singapore-beaches-coney-island-punggol-with-Singapore-beaches-100x78.png 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-177722" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Jnzl on Flickr</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are five small <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/best-beaches-singapore-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beach</a> areas on Coney Island. These beaches are accessible via earth tracks, and despite their small size, the beaches are all natural! Try looking for Coney Island Beach Area A because it can be easily found from the Coney Island West entrance.</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. Snap photos amongst Coney Island&#8217;s beautiful tall trees</h3>
<h3><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-152272" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coney-island-park-singapore-trail.jpg" alt="best parks for kids in singapore coney island cycling" width="725" height="565" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coney-island-park-singapore-trail.jpg 725w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coney-island-park-singapore-trail-300x234.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coney-island-park-singapore-trail-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></h3>
<p>We were really in awe of the endless tall trees and greenery all around the island, and although it seems that every other spot looks exactly the same, we beg to differ. Some areas are more forested with <em>lalangs</em> all around, while some are more sparse.</p>
<hr />
<h3>5. Check out the kids&#8217; obstacle course</h3>
<figure id="attachment_196059" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-196059" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-196059 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/coney-island-obstacle-course-kids-play.jpeg" alt="" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/coney-island-obstacle-course-kids-play.jpeg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/coney-island-obstacle-course-kids-play-300x233.jpeg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/coney-island-obstacle-course-kids-play-100x78.jpeg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-196059" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: NParks Coney Island</figcaption></figure>
<p>Casuarina Exploration is a kid-friendly obstacle course made up of timber from uprooted Casuarina trees, which have been collected and recycled into multiple features at Coney Island, including park signage, seats, benches, boardwalk and exhibits!</p>
<hr />
<h3>6. Relax by the Coney Island promenade</h3>
<p>On the western and eastern parts of the island, there are paved areas where you can lay your mat and enjoy the cool sea breeze with a view of passing ships and Johor&#8217;s shoreline. You can spend a good hour here taking in the fresh air.</p>
<hr />
<h3>7. Check out the mangrove boardwalk</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the trail to Beach Area C, walk through the mangrove forest. The air is so crisp and fresh. The wooden planks are made from Casuarina trees! When you&#8217;re in this area, be extra careful, because mangroves are susceptible to high tides.</p>

<h2><a name="eat"></a>Where to eat near Coney Island Singapore</h2>
<figure id="attachment_195981" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-195981" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-195981" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/coney-island-trunk-95-punggol-settlement.jpeg" alt="" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/coney-island-trunk-95-punggol-settlement.jpeg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/coney-island-trunk-95-punggol-settlement-300x233.jpeg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/coney-island-trunk-95-punggol-settlement-100x78.jpeg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-195981" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Trunk 95</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no food options on Coney Island itself. The nearest restaurant is a walk away at the Punggol Settlement, which has a number of great eateries, from cafés to casual bistros that make for some memorable riverside dining! There&#8217;s also a 7-Eleven there if you need to get essentials before or after your Coney Island Park visit.</p>

<h2>How to get to Coney Island Singapore</h2>
<h2><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173969" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/coney-island-park-guide-directions.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/coney-island-park-guide-directions.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/coney-island-park-guide-directions-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/coney-island-park-guide-directions-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></h2>

<p><strong>Best Singapore Beaches For A Day Out With The Family:</strong></p>
<h2>1. Palawan Beach Singapore: Popular beach in Singapore</h2>
<figure id="attachment_220285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-220285" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-220285" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beaches-palawan-beach-sentosa.jpg" alt="Singapore beaches - Palawan Beach Sentosa" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beaches-palawan-beach-sentosa.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beaches-palawan-beach-sentosa-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beaches-palawan-beach-sentosa-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-220285" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Sentosa</figcaption></figure>
<p>A definite contender for the best Singapore beach, you’ll find the sandy stretch of Palawan Beach between Sentosa’s Siloso Beach and Tanjong Beach (the closest Sentosa Express stop is Beach Station). What makes Palawan Beach one of the best Singapore beaches is its soft sand and family-friendly vibe. With ships on the horizon, it’s a pretty patch to set up for a sunny morning at the beach.</p>
<p>Look out for the suspension bridge that connects the Singapore beach to the Southernmost Point of Continental Asia and also Asia&#8217;s closest point to the Equator. You can swim out to the island but beware; the currents are very strong so this is only advised for very strong swimmers. Safety tip for when you are at a Singapore beach: Always swim between the Red and Yellow (&#8216;Swim Here&#8217;) flags, where the area is closely supervised by Beach Patrol officers from 9am to 7pm.</p>
<p><strong>Beachside dining: </strong>FOC Sentosa with a small plunge pool.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-169179 alignleft" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/location-icon-1024x1024-1-e1620963611654.png" alt="" width="20" height="20" />Palawan Beach Singapore</strong>, <em>Palawan Beach Walk, Sentosa Island, Singapore 098521, <a href="https://www.sentosa.com.sg/en/things-to-do/attractions/palawan-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.sentosa.com.sg</a></em></p>

<h2>2. Siloso Beach Singapore: Public beach with dining spots</h2>
<figure id="attachment_220286" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-220286" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-220286" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beaches-siloso-beach-sentosa.jpg" alt="Singapore Beaches - Siloso Beach Sentosa" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beaches-siloso-beach-sentosa.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beaches-siloso-beach-sentosa-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beaches-siloso-beach-sentosa-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-220286" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Sentosa</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another one of the best Singapore beaches, Siloso Beach, is where you’ll find family-friendly outdoor dining hot spots right by the water, and you can dine with the sand between your toes. The waters are relatively calm here, so it&#8217;s popular for families with young kids who can splash about in the sea and make sandcastles on the beach. This Singapore beach is cleaned regularly and is patrolled by Beach Officers who will advise when it is unsafe to swim.</p>
<p>The restaurant, Rumours, has pools to splash out in as well as the beach right on their doorstep, so the kids can make sandcastles while you have a coffee or cocktail. Coastes is a fave, thanks to the tables on the beach set up so that you can watch the kids play while you eat. Ola offers water sports like stand-up paddleboards and <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-kayaking-singapore-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kayaking</a> for sporty teens, whilst Trapizza is great for thin-crust pizzas close to the beach. The ticketed mega-playground Nestopia is nearby as well as the nearest Cable car stop. Come dusk, the younger crowd brings more of a party vibe to this Singapore beach. There are some great <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/travel-kid-friendly-hotels-family-staycation-singapore/">kid-friendly hotels in Singapore</a> for a family staycation located in this area, too!</p>

<h2>3. Tanjong Beach Singapore: Quiet beach in Singapore</h2>
<figure id="attachment_220284" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-220284" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-220284" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beaches-tanjong-beach-sentosa.jpg" alt="Singapore beaches - Tanjong Beach Sentosa" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beaches-tanjong-beach-sentosa.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beaches-tanjong-beach-sentosa-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beaches-tanjong-beach-sentosa-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-220284" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: The Lo &amp; Behold Group</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some say Tanjong Beach is <em>the</em> best Singapore beach as it has something for everyone, depending on the time you visit. First thing in the mornin,g this pretty stretch of sand attracts dog walkers and volleyball players. Then families with young kids descend and come early afternoon the party peeps and sun-seekers move in, taking over Tanjong Beach Club’s pool and sun loungers for cocktail time. Unlike Palawan Beach, there are safety Beach patrollers only on weekends and public holidays.</p>

<h2>4. Coney Island: Rugged Singapore beach</h2>
<figure id="attachment_220288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-220288" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-220288" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beach-coney-island.jpg" alt="Singapore beaches - Coney Island" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beach-coney-island.jpg 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beach-coney-island-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/singapore-beach-coney-island-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-220288" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: NParks</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/sassy-checks-out-coney-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coney Island</a> is a rugged Singapore beach surrounded by a vast green forest. It&#8217;s nothing like the expansive sandy Singapore beaches of Palawan or Siloso, but a trip here does make a fun seaside day out. Rather than coming here just for beach time, explore this stunningly green forested island on foot or bike along the 2.5 km Coney Island Park Connector. The beach is a hit with birdwatchers, so don&#8217;t be surprised if you spot one of 80 species of birds on Coney Island Park, including the resident male Baya Weavers, Oriental Magpies, or flocks of parakeets.</p>
<p><strong>Beachside dining: </strong>No F&amp;B here &#8212; best to pack a picnic!</p>

<h2>5. East Coast Park: Singapore beach with a cycling route</h2>
<figure id="attachment_177723" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177723" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-177723 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Singapore-beach-East-Coast-park.png" alt="Singapore beach East Coast park" width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Singapore-beach-East-Coast-park.png 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Singapore-beach-East-Coast-park-300x233.png 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Singapore-beach-East-Coast-park-100x78.png 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-177723" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: John on Flickr</figcaption></figure>

<h2>6. Changi Beach Park: Singapore beach for plane spotting</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-152270" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Changi-Beach-Park-kids.jpg" alt="parks in singapore changi beach park" width="725" height="565" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Changi-Beach-Park-kids.jpg 725w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Changi-Beach-Park-kids-300x234.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Changi-Beach-Park-kids-100x78.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></p>
<p>Plane spotters head over to Changi Beach Singapore &#8211; one of the most scenic and best beaches in Singapore &#8211; to watch low-flying planes preparing to land at Changi Airport. If you are into sandcastles and splashing around in the sea, you can enjoy that here, too, along the 3.3km long Singapore beach of Changi Beach Park. One of the best Singapore beaches, Changi Beach stretches from Changi Point to Changi Ferry Terminal and overlooks Pulau Ubin. There’s also cycling, fishing, and BBQ pits, so this is one of the best Singapore beaches for social fun.</p>
<p><strong>Beachside dining: </strong>Bistro in the park or restaurants at nearby Changi Village</p>

<h2>7. Pulau Ubin: Singapore beach with cycling</h2>

<p>Despite being an island, there is plenty to do on <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-travel-pulau-ubin-activities-scenery-food-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulau Ubin.</a> Best known for its cycling paths, Pulau Ubin also has a Singapore beach to explore. Though there is a lack of sandy shores and you really can&#8217;t swim here, this spot feels like a seaside holiday at a different pace. You can rent a bike at the shops at the jetty and cycle off to explore the island. To get ther,e just hop on a public bumboat ($3 per person) at Changi Jetty and in 15 minutes or less it&#8217;ll feel like you&#8217;re in a different country. All the deets on how to get to <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-travel-pulau-ubin-activities-scenery-food-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulau Ubin here.</a></p>

<h2>8. St. John’s Island: Boat trip to a fab Singapore beach</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114865" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/St-Johns-Island-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="420" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/St-Johns-Island-1.jpg 700w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/St-Johns-Island-1-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/St-Johns-Island-1-100x60.jpg 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Fancy a day trip complete with a boat cruise and Singapore beach on the other side? Head on over to <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/st-johns-lazarus-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St. John’s Island</a>! The best Singapore beach here is actually on Lazarus Island (<em>see below</em>) but St John&#8217;s Island is worth exploring too. Rather than beach life, St John&#8217;s offers a chance to explore flora and fauna. The lagoons to the right of the jetty are rich in starfish, crabs, and other marine life like horseshoe crabs and tropical fish. There is no F&amp;B so bring your picnic and water and have a fun picnic by the ocean!</p>
<p><strong>Beachside dining: </strong>None (pack a picnic)</p>

<h2>9. Lazarus Island: Best day trip beach in Singapore</h2>
<figure id="attachment_177724" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177724" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-177724 size-full" src="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Singapore-beach-Lazarus-Island-.png" alt="Singapore beach Lazarus Island " width="720" height="560" srcset="https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Singapore-beach-Lazarus-Island-.png 720w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Singapore-beach-Lazarus-Island--300x233.png 300w, https://www.sassymamasg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Singapore-beach-Lazarus-Island--100x78.png 100w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-177724" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Michell Tam</figcaption></figure>
<p>Lazarus Island is between St. John’s Island (where it&#8217;s connected via a paved causeway) and Kusu Island (not accessible from Lazarus Island). You&#8217;ll need to get a boat from Marina South Pier to St John&#8217;s first, then it&#8217;s about a 20-minute walk on a cement path (stroller-friendly) to Lazarus. Want a direct drop at this Singapore beach? Take a <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/st-johns-lazarus-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ferry from Sentosa Cove</a> or <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/yacht-rental-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire your own boat</a>! Lazarus Island offers a soft sandy Singapore beach with shallow waters.</p>
<p>If you want to pretend you are on holiday, this is the best Singapore beach for that! Go mid-week and it can be lovely and quiet, but this Singapore beach gets busy on weekends. There’s not much shade so bring hats and <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/kid-baby-sunscreen-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sunscreen</a>. As with St John&#8217;s Island, pack your own picnic and enjoy your meal by the sea. All the <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/st-johns-lazarus-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deets on how to get to Lazarus here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-guide-sembawang-natural-hot-springs/">Sembawang</a> Park and its grassy stretch, which becomes a sandy Singapore beach, is in the north of Singapore, facing the Straits of Johor. For kids, don&#8217;t miss the nearby <a href="https://www.sassymamasg.com/play-best-outdoor-playgrounds-singapore-free/?slide=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sembawang Playground</a> with a maritime theme. It&#8217;s one of the best Singapore beaches in the area, and you can swim, use BBQ pits, a Petanque court, and jogging paths. There are some historical aspects of the park that make this area of interest, too.</p>
<p>Here you can get a glimpse of Singapore’s naval heritage. Walk along the restored old pathways used during the British occupation or visit the Beaulieu House, the Sembawang jetty, the remains of the 1920s Seletar Pier, and Sembawang Shipyard, which was a British Naval Base from 1938 to 1968.</p>

<h2>13. Kusu Island: Singapore Beach with Temples</h2>
<p>Kusu Island is home to a famous tortoise sanctuary, so this spot is popular with fans of this sacred animal and for those wishing to visit the temples here. The Singapore beach here is small and quaint so if you are looking for a vast Singapore beach it might be better to stick to Lazarus Island. To get there, just ride one extra stop on the St. John&#8217;s Island ferry that departs from Marina South Pier.</p>

<h2><strong>Safety swim tips for Singapore beaches:</strong></h2>
<p>Not all Singapore beaches are patrolled by lifeguards, so swim at your own risk and never leave children unattended. Always be wary of strong undercurrents. Where Singapore beaches are monitored, a red flag indicates that it is dangerous to swim, possibly due to lightning warnings, strong currents, jellyfish or other hazards (oil spill, poor visibility, flotsam).</p>
<p><em>Enjoy your beach trip and stay safe!</em></p>

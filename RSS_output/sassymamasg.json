      "content": "As parents, we want to support our kids the best we can. Finding the right help at The Learning Lab can make all the difference. If your child is in primary school, you’ll know that PSLE is a huge milestone for both the child and the parents. Effective PSLE prep can do wonders, not just to give your child a confidence boost, but also to allow parents to focus on being supportive. For many parents, The Learning Lab is the key to a smooth PSLE journey. With more than 20 years of experience under their belt, a thoughtful teaching approach that helps students build a strong academic foundation and a genuine love for learning, it’s no wonder so many families continue to return to The Learning Lab. A track record that speaks for itself – but it’s more than just grades It’s the results that first catch our eye: 1 in 3 students scored AL1 in English, Math or Science in the 2024 PSLEs. Half of their students scored a PSLE Achievement Level of 8 or lower, and 60% scored AL1 or AL2 in the subjects they received support at The Learning Lab. But what sets it apart? They’ve got a magic spark that makes students excited to learn. Lessons at The Learning Lab aren’t about drilling information. Instead, they are crafted to spark curiosity and build deeper thinking. With resources like retrieval practices and error analysis worksheets, students become more independent and resilient, skills that will help them thrive beyond the exam hall. Classroom materials at The Learning Lab are carefully crafted by 40 in-house curriculum specialists. Everything is aligned with the MOE syllabus, but it’s standouts like the “Staying Plugged In” (SPI) curriculum series that takes learning one step further. Real-world events such as Polling Day or the wildfires in L.A. are integrated into lessons, cultivating a global perspective in young learners to show them that what they are learning matters. “My children look forward to their lessons every week,” says Mr Alvin Lian, dad of two students from The Learning Lab. “Often, they are excited to share the things they have learned from their lessons!” he explained, noting that he’s observed how his sons think critically and deeply about issues around them. Personalised teaching that meets your child where they are On top of their effective curriculum, the teachers at The Learning Lab take the time to understand the child, their learning habits, strengths and areas where they need additional support. It’s this personalised approach that can give your child the boost they need, not just academically, but in how they approach learning altogether. As Primary 6 student Sarah Choong puts it, “I found the notes really helpful. One thing I really took away from my lessons with TLL was the importance of flexibility […] I realised that learning is not really about memorising. Even though I read as much as I could, what I really really appreciated [was] learning how to fit examples into my work in a proper way.” With committed teachers, a well-designed curriculum and an environment that builds confidence, The Learning Lab helps students not just meet, but exceed their goals. And the shift in learning mindset? That’s priceless. If you’ve been looking for that extra edge and a place where your child will feel supported, challenged and inspired, look no further than The Learning Lab. Join thousands of families who trust The Learning Lab to help their children reach their PSLE goals and beyond. Enrol your child for Term 3 and discover how the right guidance can make all the difference. Be one of the first 50 parents to sign your child up to enjoy a complimentary trial class for a new subject. This promotion ends 30 June 2025.

Explore everything from shallow waters to the deep sea, and prehistoric oceans to today’s waters. Here’s what we know so far: We were sad to see S.E.A. Aquarium go when our favourite aquarium closed its doors on 30 April 2025. But it wasn’t goodbye forever! In its place is the all-new Singapore Oceanarium, which is three times bigger than its predecessor. Good news, folks: it’ll be opening on 23 July 2025! That’s just before the school holidays wrap, giving us something to pad the post- June holiday blues. With 22 zones to explore, families can look forward to some great new additions at the Singapore Oceanarium. We’re plenty excited about the prehistoric underwater world, the massive collection of sea jellies, the new walking net and its many new teractive elements.

The Singapore Oceanarium is now three times larger than its predecessor, with 22 zones that allow visitors to connect with the marine world.

To kick things off, kids can grab a Gallery Children’s Biennale 2025 Art Pack, which is a colourful kit packed with art supplies, easy-to-follow instructions, and creative prompts inspired by the artworks. With baby-friendly installations featured for the first time, the Art Packs now come in two versions: one for ages six and under, and one for seven and up! Check out full details of each installation below. 1. Embracing the Future with Joy Image credit: Gallery Children’s Biennale 2025 Some of the installations at the Gallery Children’s Biennale 2025 are by local artists, including Embracing the Future with Joy by Fern Wong. This vibrant installation features Fern’s signature papercut art and invites children to explore what happiness means to them through bright hues, playful textures, and patterns. Kids can help complete a giant magnetic wall design adding their own creative touch to the artwork. For the smaller ones, there’s a dedicated corner with a sensorial “busy board” filled with sound makers, mazes, and textured panels designed to support early development while keeping little hands engaged! Where: Spine Hall 2. Dance Dance Chromatics Image credit: Gallery Children’s Biennale 2025 At Dance Dance Chromatics, local artist Wyn-Lyn Tan invites children to experience art in motion. This installation is set against a stunning AI-generated video wall inspired by two decades of the artist’s paintings and transforms movement into colour and emotion. Kids can jump, twirl and step on four-floor pads that trigger visual changes in the digital landscape. With motion sensors, little ones get to explore how movement and colour can express joy. 3. Empowering the World through Kindness Image credit: Gallery Children’s Biennale 2025 Kindness Garden is a sensory-filled installation by Japanese artist Hiromi Tango that encourages children to explore empathy through sight, sound, touch, and smell. Surrounded by oversized flowers, kids can discover messages of kindness written in braille, offering a glimpse into how the visually impaired experience the world. At the heart of the garden is a “sound flower” that invites playful interaction through sound and movement. Designed with inclusivity in mind, the installation also features calm domes filled with lavender-scented plushies, creating a quiet, soothing space especially thoughtful for neurodivergent children. 4. Lessons in Being Kind Image credit: Gallery Children’s Biennale 2025 Lessons in Being Kind features a stop-motion film by Laotian artist Souliya Phoumivong, where kids can explore themes of identity, self-acceptance, and the power of kindness through the adventures of colourful blob-like characters. Get creative at the activity area by making your own stop-motion videos, and let the kids have fun at the balancing chair! 5. I WE THEM Image credit: Gallery Children’s Biennale 2025 I WE THEM is a whimsical installation that transforms everyday surroundings into playful, character-like forms. Designed to spark connection and comfort, families are invited to slow down and share moments together. Babies and toddlers can explore freely in a soft ‘flower bed’ filled with gentle sculptures encouraging sensory and emotional development, while older kids will enjoy giving high-fives to a giant inflatable hand and spinning seven rotating discs of different sizes! 6. Home is Where the Heart Is Image credit: Gallery Children’s Biennale 2025 Inspired by Mohamed Salehuddin’s Malay House in Malacca in 1960, Home is Where the Heart Is is an imagined neighbourhood that celebrates Singapore’s rich and diverse heritage. This vibrant mural invites children to explore what home means to them through playful, interactive elements. Here, they can ring a doorbell, open a neighbour’s door, or listen to greetings from a cheerful ice cream seller. Parents and grandparents can also share memories of past homes, sparking conversations that connect generations and deepen appreciation for the places we come from. 7. Fantasy Image credit: Gallery Children’s Biennale 2025 Fantasy is an installation by Malaysia-based art collective Co2_karbondioksida that transforms 130kg of upcycled children’s clothing and nearly 400 donated toys into a dreamy, sustainable space. At its centre hangs a large-scale mobile made from repurposed toys. Soft cubes crafted from donated clothes cover the cushioned floor, providing a safe and cosy area for babies and young children to explore. While playing, visitors are also encouraged to think about waste, overconsumption, and the environment. 8. Imaginary Peach Garden Image credit: Gallery Children’s Biennale 2025 Imaginary Peach Garden by South Korean artist YeSeung Lee blends technology and storytelling through an interactive installation. Inspired by traditional tazo puzzle cards and animals from Korean and Southeast Asian folktales, children can create their own fantastical creatures in two ways: by piecing together physical foam puzzles or using digital devices to form shapes projected onto the wall.

      "content": "Bathtime is more than just hygiene. Parenting coach Swetha Vigraham explains when parents can let go of the reins and how it teaches important lessons in independence, body respect, and personal boundaries. When my son was born, I received three baby rockers as gifts from friends. Like many new parents, I learned the importance of better communication to avoid duplicates. But since I had three, I made the best of them: one as a dining chair, another as a naptime bed, and the last—most unusually—as a bathing buddy. Yes, one of the rockers found its home next to the glass shower partition. My son, like many babies, had an uncanny ability to sense when I was showering. Even if he was napping, the sound of water would wake him, and he’d cry inconsolably until he could see me through the glass. This began our unique bathing adventures. As my workload increased, so did my son’s hours in childcare. To compensate for missing playtime, I created two sacred routines: his bath time and bedtime. These moments became our special bonding rituals, filled with giggles, bubbles, and heartwarming questions. Until one day, as he threw a curious question about my body, I realised it was time to respect both our privacies. It was time for him to start bathing independently. Read more: How To Talk To Kids About Their Bodies & Inappropriate Touch How do you know your child is ready? Image credit: Freepik Ability: Does your child have the physical coordination to stand steadily in the shower and handle the showerhead? Capability: Can they understand bathroom safety? For example, mixing hot and cold water safely and avoiding water play near electrical appliances. Curiosity: Are they asking questions about their bodies and showing signs of self-awareness? Confidence: Are they expressing the desire to bathe themselves, perhaps starting with soaping or rinsing? While I worried whether my son could clean his back properly or dry himself thoroughly, I knew I had to support this milestone while treasuring the memories we had built. Why is bath time more than just hygiene? For toddlers, bath time is about splashing and playing. For older children, it transforms into an important lesson in independence, body respect, and personal boundaries. These are crucial for their self-esteem and body positivity, especially as they approach puberty. With my son, we took it step by step—starting with washing his legs and stomach, then moving to his face and tricky back. By age six, he was confidently managing his bath time, and I felt a mix of pride and bittersweet nostalgia.

Image credit: Mateus Andre via Freepik Take Small Steps: Introduce independent tasks early, like soaping their body (ages 3 to 5), washing their body but not hair (ages 6 to 8), and gradually building up to full independence by age 9-12. Have Conversations: Respect their readiness. If they express interest, encourage them. If not, gently ask how they feel about starting. Provide Support: Equip them with age-appropriate tools like anti-slip mats, light towels, and visual checklists to remind them of the steps. Be Nearby: Stay close enough to assist if needed, especially during the early stages. Cultural differences and individual preferences play a role in this transition. Remember to adapt based on your child’s personality and developmental pace. Bathing is a milestone in the Parent-Child Journey. I will always cherish the splashes and giggles of bath time. But as my son grows, our bonding moments have shifted. Now, we enjoy long walks, cosy reading sessions, or lazy afternoons at the pool. Letting go of caregiving responsibilities can be bittersweet, but it’s also an act of love. So, the next time your child says, “I can do it myself,” take a deep breath and let them try. You’re not just teaching them independence; you’re strengthening your bond in new ways. The post When Should Your Child Be Bathing Independently? appeared first on Sassy Mama .",

      "content": "Looking for fun activities for your tween or teenager in Singapore? From thrill-seeking activities to more chilled hang out spots, here are some ideas to hint at! One of the things we love about living in Singapore is how safe it is compared to other places meaning kids can often commute solo from a younger age than in other countries. With teenagers, we can afford them more freedom with independent outings than we would if we were living somewhere else. And in Singapore, there are plenty of activities for kids and teenagers. From checking out water parks, go-karting and outdoor parks to hanging out at the best cafes selling amazing ice cream and gelatos . If you’re looking for some inspiration to keep your teens busy in Singapore, here’s our list of fun teen activities – whether your teen chooses to go on these adventures with you or with their friends! Obviously, you can’t be the one to suggest these ideas to your teens – that’d be way uncool. But hey, a subtle hint never hurt anyone. Maybe casually mention a weekend hangout? You know, just in case they’re suddenly interested in exploring fun things to do around Singapore during the weekend ! Read more: Best Water Parks and Play Areas in Singapore Best activities for teenagers in Singapore: 1. Make a splash at teen-approved water parks Image credit: Wild Wild Wet If you’re new here, you should know that water parks are a favourite with the Sassy Mama team. They’re perfect activities for all ages (yes, even parents!) and they’re the best places to be to escape Singapore’s tropical heat. Wild Wild Wet at Downtown East is a longtime favourite, with rides that range from easy-going to seriously thrilling. It’s compact enough that you won’t lose sight of your tweens, but still packed with enough splashy action to keep your teens buzzing. Got a daredevil? Point them straight to the Torpedo – they’ll thank you for the adrenaline rush. Adventure Cove Waterpark is another great water park in Sentosa and a trip here can easily fill a whole day. Thrillseekers will love the Riptide Rocket or for something calmer visit the Rainbow Reef or the Adventure River. Splashworks is where to head for various challenges including climbing ropes, balancing beams and more!

Go on a nature walk at Singapore’s parks Image credit: NParks If you’re up for some fresh air and quality time, exploring Singapore’s beautiful parks is a great way to reconnect with your teen. Whether you’re cycling through scenic trails, taking on a treetop walk, or ziplining through lush greenery, there’s something for every kind of adventure level. You’ll also find wide-open spaces perfect for kite-flying, kicking a ball around, or just chilling on a picnic mat! 3. Try an escape room challenge with your teens Image credit: Science Centre Singapore via Facebook Want something to get those teenagers thinking and brainstorming together? Why not try out these escape rooms where teens can uncover clues and solve riddles together? Designed with a theme in mind, escape room games are incredibly immersive with detailed storylines that make you feel like you’re a movie character. But these games aren’t just pure fun. In fact, teens will have to pool together critical thinking skills to pick out clues that will help them progress forward and find the exit!

      "content": "Beaches, luxurious resorts, spas and fab hospitality: Phuket makes a great family-friendly destination near Singapore. Read on for all the best things to do in Phuket with kids, where to stay, when to visit and more. Located just a two-hour flight from Singapore, Phuket is a convenient holiday destination that’s packed with family-friendly fun. Not only do we love the island’s beautiful beaches, islands and reefs, but we also love that it’s got some great kids’ activities (despite it also being known for adult-only “fun” at Patong). For families planning a Phuket itinerary, here are all the best things to do in Phuket with kids, including where to stay (Club Med Phuket is a win, for us!) and the best time to travel to Phuket. While you’re looking at Thailand destinations, be sure to check out our travel guide to Hua Hin , Chiang Mai and Koh Samui . Or, check out these amazing hotel kids’ clubs in Southeast Asia . ↓ Scroll down for all the best things to do in Phuket with kids ↓ Jump to: – Best time to visit Phuket – Singapore to Phuket flights – Things to do in Phuket – Where to stay in Phuket Best time to visit Phuket The best time to visit Phuket is between November and April, during the dry season. During this time, Phuket experiences low rainfall and clear waters. The rainy season in Phuket starts in May and ends in October. During the monsoon season in Phuket, the island experiences lots of thunderstorms, so don’t expect to be doing many beach and water activities during this time.. Nevertheless, May and October are still considered great times to travel to Phuket as they’re off-peak with occasional showers. Meanwhile, peak travel season in Phuket is from December to February. Singapore to Phuket flights Flights between Singapore and Phuket take only about two hours, making it a convenient getaway for families from Singapore. Direct flights from Singapore to Phuket are available daily on Singapore Airlines, Scoot and Jetstar. Things to do in Phuket with kids Explore Phuket islands: Popular Phuket tourist attraction Image credit: Pelago One of the best things to do in Phuket is island-hopping, especially with tour operators at nearly every corner of the island. That said, a visit to Phi Phi Islands is worth it for its backpacker vibes and calm, clear waters; Similan Islands for diving and snorkelling amidst colourful reefs; and Coral Island for its white sand beaches. Island-hopping can usually be done within a day (or even half a day, if you start early), and is great for admiring the island’s spectacular marine life. You can book a snorkelling tour in Phuket here . Naka Weekend Night Market: Phuket Night Market Image credit: Naka Weekend Night Market Can you really say you’ve visited Phuket without spending an evening at a night market? Phuket night markets are a must for great shopping and street food, and you can start at the famous Naka Weekend Night Market. You’ll find live entertainment, cafes, cheap seafood and lots of souvenirs and beachwear–all suitable for families without the more “adult” elements of the markets at Patong Beach. Of course, finding a night market in Phuket is easy as they’re pretty much everywhere! Other night markets to visit: Phuket Old Town Sunday Night Market and Kata Night Market. Naka Weekend Night Market, Wirat Hong Yok Rd, Wichit, Mueang Phuket District, Phuket 83000, Thailand, www.phuketnakamarket.com Visit a Phuket elephant sanctuary: Things to do in Phuket with kids Image credit: Phuket Elephant Sanctuary Wondering what to do in Phuket with kids? Bring the little ones to see majestic elephants in their natural habitat at the Phuket Elephant Sanctuary in the Thalang District. This 30-acre park is home to rescued elephants who’ve spent their lives in captivity–that means no unethical practices such as elephant shows and riding. Instead, visitors can observe them from a 500-metre-long Canopy Walkway (Thailand’s largest!), take guided tours or volunteer to help out at the sanctuary. You’ll be able to find plenty more Phuket elephant sanctuaries around the island. However, we highly recommend doing some research and reading reviews before choosing one to visit to ensure they practice ethical treatment of the elephants. Phuket Elephant Sanctuary, 100, Pa Klok, Thalang District, Chang Wat Phuket 83110, Thailand, www.phuketelephantsanctuary.org Carnival Magic Phuket & Phuket FantaSea: Fun things to do in Phuket Image credit: Carnival Magic Phuket Dazzling lights, vibrant colours and over-the-top theatrics quite aptly describe the cultural theme parks of Phuket, Carnival Magic Phuket and Phuket FantaSea. Considered one of the most entertaining things to do in Phuket, these cultural parks provide next-level entertainment for families: think parades, acrobatics, funfairs and large-scale cultural performances. Carnival Magic Phuket is said to be the more family-friendly of the two; Phuket FantaSea is also thoroughly entertaining, however, it’s good to note that Phuket FantaSea features live animals, which sparks some concerns regarding the ethical treatment of animals. Carnival Magic Phuket, 999 Kamala, Kathu District, Phuket 83150, Thailand, www.carnivalmagic.fun Phuket FantaSea, 99, Kamala, Kathu District, Phuket 83150, Thailand, www.phuketfantasea.fun Andamanda Phuket: Phuket water park Image credit: Andamanda Phuket Andamanda Phuket is a water park in Phuket that embodies the theme of Thai culture and myths. Tucked between traditional Thai architecture are thrilling water slides (there’s a good variety of them, too!), lazy rivers, wave pools and lots of entertainment. Just take note that the park is a rather popular Phuket attraction. You can expect crowds during the weekends and during the holiday season, so be prepared for longer wait times on the more popular slides. Andamanda Phuket, 333, Kathu, Kathu District, Phuket 83120, Thailand, www.andamandaphuket.com Central Festival Phuket: Shopping in Phuket Image credit: Aquaria Phuket If you need a place to hide from the scorching sun or rain, Central Festival Phuket is your best bet. This shopping mall in Phuket has plenty of modern retail stores, designer brands, and restaurants, which is fantastic if you want to shop in air-conditioned comfort. It’s also home to Aquaria Phuket, Thailand’s largest aquarium and Phuket’s very own Trick Eye Museum. Central Festival Phuket, 74,75 Moo5, Vichit, Muang, Phuket, 83000, Thailand, www.centralphuket.com Phuket Old Town: Lesser-known things to do in Phuket When it comes to things to do in Phuket, it’s obvious that the beach life is the highlight of this island destination. But if you’ve got little explorers with you, then Phuket Old Town is worth a visit. Phuket Old Town has a myriad of Sino-Portuguese buildings and street art, shrines and markets. If you’re on a shorter Phuket itinerary, then a day trip to Phuket Old Town would be adequate to see the key Phuket attractions. Still, avid travellers recommend spending at least two days here to really experience the local culture. Beaches in Phuket: Best things to do in Phuket with kids Image credit: loliloop via Getty Phuket has plenty of beaches and tonnes of great resorts. If you’re having trouble deciding which area is best for you, then here’s a brief rundown of some of the most popular beaches in Phuket: Patong Beach: Arguably the most popular and touristy area of Phuket, known for its adult entertainment and vibrant party scene. This area is more suitable for adults looking to have fun. Karon Beach and Kata Beach: These beaches, located south of Patong Beach, are also popular tourist destinations in Phuket, but are known for their more laid-back atmosphere. Karon Beach is a long stretch of white sand beach, while Kata Beach is known for surfing and watersports. Kamala Beach, Surin Beach, Nai Harn Beach: These are some of the most secluded beaches in Phuket. Great for families looking for a quiet getaway. Bangla Road Phuket: Things to do in Phuket for adults Need a break from the kiddos? Bangla Road is where you can experience the epitome of Phuket’s vibrant nightlife. This area is lined with bars adorned with neon lights and dancers, blasting loud music. You’ll also find street performers, artists and street-side stalls selling souvenirs and snacks. Bangla Road Phuket is the area where you’ll find lots of the adult entertainment Phuket is so well-known for, so it’s definitely not recommended for kids. Where to stay in Phuket: Family-friendly resorts in Phuket Club Med Phuket: All-inclusive Phuket beach resort Image credit: Club Med Phuket Beach? Check. Kids club? Check. Kid-friendly food? Check! At Club Med Phuket, you’re pretty much guaranteed a fuss-free stay with the kiddos with its all-inclusive concept. And now with Club Med Phuket’s all-new Family Oasis, you’ll find it hard to peel yourself away from this family-friendly resort in Phuket. The Family Oasis is a brand new space that includes all-new family rooms and the Splash Park, a mini water park with plenty of water jets, winding water slides and cabanas (including kid-sized ones!) that’s pretty much a sunny utopia for young ones. Pair all this with Club Med Phuket’s family-friendly offerings, and you’ve got a holiday the kids will remember for years to come. The kids’ club here isn’t just confined to the physical kids’ club building. Throughout the day you’ll see the various groups of kids, from preschoolers to teens, taking part in a myriad of activities. Kids can try their hand at circus school (fancy, a flying trapeze class, anyone?), take part in workshops, have pool and foam parties, and more. After dinner, catch an entertaining nightly show–mostly performed by Club Med Phuket’s friendly and energetic staff members–followed by parties for the grown-ups. With the kids occupied at the kids’ club, Mum and Dad can also get some alone time. We love that there’s an adult-only Zen Pool and an on-site spa for winding down. Not to mention, plenty of wellness and sports activities, including Thai Boxing, snorkelling and more–all included in your stay!

      "content": "Interested in a Montessori education for your child? We explain the Montessori method’s core principles and round up Montessori preschools in Singapore to consider! If you are looking into Montessori preschools in Singapore for your tot and have a million questions about what the Montessori method entails, we’ve got your back! Wondering whether a Montessori education in Singapore offers mixed-age classes and which kindergartens adhere to Montessori principles? We’ve found the answers you need and have even shortlisted several Montessori preschools in Singapore to get you started. Keep scrolling to learn more about Montessori education in Singapore. Jump to: What is the Montessori Method? How Montessori Education Works in Singapore Montessori Preschools in Singapore Read more: Ultimate Guide to Kindergartens and Preschools What is the Montessori Method? With schools around the world and a slew of famous alumni, the Montessori method has a reputation for encouraging curiosity and “outside the box” thinking in children. It’s a child-centred educational approach developed over 100 years ago by Maria Montessori – Italy’s first female doctor. According to The American Montessori Society, the Montessori method “is a view of the child as one who is naturally eager for knowledge and capable of initiating learning in a supportive, thoughtfully prepared learning environment. It is an approach that values the human spirit and the development of the whole child – physical, social, emotional and cognitive.” In short, kids are sponges, and given the freedom to explore and learn at their own pace, their minds will flourish. A “true” Montessori school possesses the following core traits: Mixed-age classrooms that facilitate peer learning (younger kids learn from older kids, and the older kids reinforce their own learning by teaching the younger kids) Uninterrupted blocks of work time (typically in three-hour intervals) Children can choose their own activities (with guidance and encouragement from teachers) Specially designed learning materials that aren’t toys A deliberately arranged classroom environment (nary a desk in sight!) Teachers trained at official Montessori training centres certified by Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) No grades or tests Focus on four key areas: Practical life, Sensorial, Language and Mathematics With children in many ways left to their own devices, Montessori is thought to foster independence, leadership skills and self-control. A 2006 study by Science Magazine found that by the end of kindergarten, Montessori children “performed better on standardised tests of reading and math, engaged in more positive interaction on the playground, and showed more advanced social cognition and executive control. They also showed more concern for fairness and justice.” How Montessori Education Works in Singapore Image credit: Getty Images Because Montessori is more of a philosophy than a rigid curriculum, any school can call itself Montessori, even if it barely adheres to the core principles. They would certainly seem to be at odds with Singapore, where testing, grades and a strict classroom environment play a huge role in the educational system (and rules and parameters tend to guide daily life in general!). Parents who fret about how their child will perform in P1 are understandably nervous about a system without grades or testing – how can I ensure my child is on the right track? All that said, there are many satisfied parents out there who feel Montessori instilled critical thinking skills and independence in their kids as well as a strong foundation in reading, writing and math. Some children might struggle to adapt to the rigidity of desks and homework after being at a Montessori school at first, but kids are highly adaptable, and often, the strong foundation and educational curiosity seem to win out. Make sure to reach out to any school you’re investigating to speak with current and former parents. Montessori schools in Singapore typically encourage parents and prospective parents to observe classrooms to get a feel for the programme and how it might work for their child. Montessori Preschools & Kindergartens in Singapore While we’ve listed out some of the most established Montessori preschools in Singapore, our list is hardly exhaustive and is certainly not an official list of endorsed schools. As you’ll see, hardly any Singapore Montessori schools meet all of the core Montessori criteria listed above. The tradeoff is that many Montessori schools have created an environment thought to help kids more easily transition into Singapore’s traditional educational system – many have fantastic Mandarin immersion programmes, while still incorporating the flexible style and unique materials of the Montessori method. When you are looking for a Montessori school you can ask if they adhere to the Montessori school core traits listed above to see for yourself which schools best suit what you are looking for. ↓ Keep scrolling to discover Montessori preschools in Singapore!

      "content": "Macbeth on Roblox is a new Roblox game where students can explore and learn about the fascinating world of one of William Shakespeare’s most famous tragedies through the eyes of the brave Scottish general Macbeth. Roblox is all the rage these days, but the good news is that parents now have a way to inject some educational benefits via the game. Macbeth on Roblox is the latest brainchild of Singapore Repertory Theatre (SRT), newly launched on 7 May 2025. As its title suggests, it’s an immersive game that brings one of William Shakespeare’s most famous plays, Macbeth, to life! Just think of it as a digital extension of SRT’s ever-popular Shakespeare in the Park – Macbeth , which also returns to the Fort Canning stage on the same day! In the game, players can step into Macbeth’s world and experience his story firsthand. Yes, battles and all! Here’s what to expect: Students can explore the classic tale through a platform they love In case you don’t already know, Macbeth tells the tale of a brave Scottish general who was tempted by power after being told by three witches that he would one day become king. Because of his greed, he’s willing to stop at nothing to sit on the throne, including murdering the current king! However, once he becomes king, Macbeth becomes paranoid and violent and loses his sense of right and wrong, and more people suffer as a result. Definitely an important learning point that true greatness comes from integrity and not ambition alone. In this immersive Roblox game, players can roleplay as Macbeth himself and explore some of the most dramatic moments in the play. It’s a stylised, sci-fi version of the story, where players get to make key decisions and face the consequences of Macbeth’s ambition. Whether your kid is a fan of Roblox or not, this unique game is the perfect way to introduce them to the well-loved classic tale. The game also has exciting content updates lined up, including new scenes that will be added over time. A unique way to introduce the teens to Shakespeare Macbeth on Roblox was developed with the National Arts Council, where it can also be used as an educational tool and a useful classroom resource. The game is designed to support MOE’s Literature in English curriculum and helps students better understand and appreciate the story of Macbeth in a way that feels fresh and relatable. This is especially useful for students who are studying the play for Literature lessons! If you’re planning to catch Shakespeare in the Park – Macbeth at Fort Canning (which we highly recommend!), and bringing your super-digital, knows-nothing-about-Shakespeare kids along, Macbeth on Roblox is the perfect way to get them curious and excited. It’s a fun, hands-on way to explore the story before seeing it live. Plus, it’s educational, so that screen time? Totally worth it!

      "content": "“When I broke the news to my daughter that our helper was leaving, she was silent and stared off into space, refusing to look at me or let me touch her. My little 4-year-old couldn’t process that her ‘best friend’ Aunty Min would likely never return.” “Mama,” my 4-year-old daughter Lana called me, as she came into my room. “Aunty Min is crying,” she said about my helper, Min. A million thoughts ran through my head: Was it heartbreak? Did something happen to a family member? Could she be … pregnant? It’s okay, I thought. We’ve gotten through her appendicitis, getting cheated on by her boyfriend, losing her grandmother, and more in the past. We surely can get through this, right? “Ma’am,” Min approached me, trembling, when I came out of the room. She reached out and held my hand, and my heart dropped. I held my breath. “Ma’am. I’m so sorry, Ma’am. I need to go back to Myanmar … for my family,” she said, tears streaming down her face. I said, “It’s okay, Min…” “Ma’am, you and Sir have been so good to me, I’m so sorry,” she broke down sobbing and pulled me into a hug. I knew at that moment there was little chance we could convince her to stay. My helper of three years was really leaving, even though she was happy with us. And although it had only been a relatively short time, Min was part of our family and shared a special bond with my daughter Lana. Here’s our story with our unexpected angel, who saved our family from falling apart when we were at our most vulnerable. Read more: All About Helper Appreciation In Singapore We initially didn’t want a helper Image credit: Freepik Min was the first and only helper we interviewed. We had zero experience with having a helper in Singapore , but we were desperate at that time. Min spoke little to no English, but we ended up hiring her off “good vibes”. We had initially been reluctant to hire a helper. Plenty of people around me seemed to be able to do without (with multiple kids, mind you!), and we didn’t feel comfortable with having a “stranger” living in our home. I was also nervous about how Lana would adapt, seeing that she was extremely clingy with me. But with my husband’s airline pilot roster and my severe lack of a “village” in Singapore, we were struggling to hold everything together. Lana was a very spritely 1.5-year-old, and I was working full-time. Yes, we sent her to a childcare centre during the day, but on the days she fell sick and stayed home, it was impossible for me to get any work or chores done. With my husband often away–or recuperating from flights–my life was 24/7 childcare, work and chores. My social life and my me-time became nonexistent. I won’t go into the details, but the complete loss of identity and stress of managing everything on my own eventually began to eat away at my mental health. Not to mention, spiralling into petty arguments with my husband. After nights of breaking down and many, many talks about how we were going to improve our situation, we finally gave in and started looking for a helper to take some of the load off my shoulders. Read more: ‘There’s a protective mama bear part of me who just wants her kids to herself.’ How my helper became my “co-parent” Image credit: freepic.diller via Freepik Min naturally seemed nervous when she arrived. I showed her around the house, gave her a rundown of her duties, and showed her what needed to be done. She pretty much got to work right away. Then, in the evening when Lana came home from childcare, Min’s eyes lit up. Lana was often shy around strangers, but Min approached her and started playing with her, singing nursery rhymes and letting Lana show her her toys. Lana warmed up quickly. It turned out we were going to be okay. Lana and Min bonded and got along like a house on fire. Eventually, Min was able to step in when I needed help with mealtimes, bath time and bedtime. After over a year and a half of never having gone out without Lana or spending all my free time cleaning, I was able to regain some freedom. I was able to meet friends for dinner, go on date nights with my husband, or simply have an extra pair of hands to mind Lana when I was tied up or overwhelmed. Min was always delighted to spend time with Lana, treating her as if she were her own. In fact, she was rather overprotective of Lana, always keeping a close eye on her safety when she was playing or climbing around. There were times I even felt a little envious of their relationship–Lana often preferred for Min to carry her, feed her, bathe her and play with her. They had their own inside jokes and conversations filled with huge laughter. Some may say I didn’t set boundaries, but Min and Lana would say “I love you” to each other in Burmese. She even taught Lana how to count and say other basic phrases in Burmese. I quickly brushed that feeling of envy off, as I knew I’d always be Lana’s Mummy and that I was extremely lucky to have a helper who genuinely cared for my child. With Min now sharing my parenting load, it very much felt like she was my co-parent. Of course, Min and I still had that employee-employer boundary, but we cared for each other. Whenever I was sick, Min would make sure to ask if I needed anything and then spring into action to mind Lana so I could rest. Likewise, we always ensured that Min knew she had us for support: we talked through her heartbreak, family problems and more. We always got each other gifts during special occasions and included her in all of our family celebrations, and she would bring back her favourite Burmese desserts for us when she went back to visit her family. My husband and I would also often chat with her about her life and her family back home. Min is not married and has no kids, and is extremely close with her mum and siblings. She had even set up a small business back home to support her siblings and niece. It was obvious that Min was the rock of her family and that everything she does is for them. Saying goodbye to our unexpected angel Image credit: jcomp via Freepik Min was delighted to renew her contract after two years, and we always hoped that she would stay with us long-term. But that wasn’t in the cards for us. Min’s family was experiencing some hardships back in Myanmar, and they needed her to be with them. We knew that she wouldn’t be able to continue working in Singapore with such a weight on her shoulders. Family always comes first, we say, and so we supported her decision to leave. I didn’t expect myself to feel so devastated when the reality of her leaving hit me. When I broke the news to Lana that Min was leaving, Lana was silent and stared off into space, refusing to look at me or let me touch her. My little 4-year-old couldn’t process that her “best friend” would likely never return. I explained to Lana that her Aunty Min had to go home to her family, and that we’ll always be thankful for having had her around these past three years. Lana then went to Min’s room to give her a hug, before breaking down and crying inconsolably. “We still have time,” I told Lana, “Let’s just enjoy the last couple of months we have with Aunty Min, okay?” Lana cried herself to sleep in my arms that night. The next day, she seemed to be back to normal, and so we carried on with our lives, periodically reminding Lana that her Aunty Min was leaving soon and that we’d have a new Aunty around. Lana seems to have accepted that Min is leaving, and we’re prepared for an adjustment period once our new helper arrives . Min is leaving in a few days’ time, and there’s an obvious skip in her step. There’s also a heaviness in her–she’s happy that she will finally get to be with her family, but she’s also dreading the day she has to part ways with Lana. Due to the current situation in Myanmar, as well as Min’s family situation, it is unlikely that Min will ever return to work in Singapore. As for my husband and me, we will always appreciate how Min became such an unexpected but amazing part of our little family. I don’t know if she realises just how much she did for us, but I made sure to let her know how grateful we were. We will always appreciate how, back in Myanmar, there’ll be a hardworking 30-year-old Min who has a heart of pure gold, is exceptionally resourceful and smart, who always puts others before herself, and who helped us get through one of our most vulnerable times.

      "content": "She built the largest indoor playground in Singapore, and then 10 more across four countries. We chat with Heidi Tian, the founder and CEO of Kiztopia, about motherhood and what it’s like seeing her childhood vision of play come to life. Before moving to Singapore, Heidi Tian was deep in the world of banking—think long hours and fast-paced cities. But after becoming a mum, her priorities started to shift. She wanted more balance, and when she got to Singapore in 2012, something clicked: where were the big, fun, indoor play spaces for kids? That question planted the seed for Kiztopia . Leaving behind a steady corporate job to start something from scratch wasn’t easy—there were delays, tough calls and plenty of unknowns. But when she walked into her first completed playground, filled with colour, exploration and wide-eyed kids, it all felt worth it. We speak to Heidi about how her childhood inspired her love for play and exploration, how she started one of the region’s largest indoor playground chains (Kiztopia has 18 outlets across Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia!), and what drives her as a parent. Read our past That Mama interviews here . What was your life like before moving to Singapore in 2012? Before moving to Singapore, I spent most of my career in banking, working in the fast-paced financial hubs of the U.S., China, and Hong Kong. While I enjoyed the structured corporate world, becoming a mother shifted my priorities. I found myself searching for more ways to balance career ambitions with family life. When I moved to Singapore, I noticed a gap in the market where there weren’t many large-scale indoor play experiences that combined fun with learning. That realisation ultimately planted the seed for Kiztopia. Having lived in the U.S., China and Hong Kong previously, what are the biggest differences you’ve noticed about raising kids there vs. in Singapore? Every country has a unique parenting culture. In the United States, there’s a strong emphasis on outdoor exploration and fostering independence. In China, structured learning plays a more significant role, and in Hong Kong, limited space means play is often centred around smaller activity zones. Singapore offers an ideal mix: it’s safe, has excellent infrastructure, and encourages both academic excellence and recreational play. Image credit: Kiztopia The pressure of stepping into entrepreneurship from your corporate role must’ve been high. What were some of your most challenging moments, and what were your biggest motivators during that time? Stepping into entrepreneurship was both exhilarating and daunting. One of the biggest challenges was taking that first leap, leaving behind the stability of my corporate career and stepping into the unknown. The early days were filled with uncertainty, from securing the right locations to designing an entirely new concept that stood out in the market. There were moments when things didn’t go as planned—delays, operational hurdles, and the immense responsibility of leading a team. Despite these challenges, my biggest motivator was the vision of what Kiztopia could become. I believed deeply in creating a space where children could learn and grow through play. Seeing families enjoy our playgrounds and hearing parents share how Kiztopia has become a special part of their children’s lives made every challenge worthwhile. Another major source of strength came from my team and my family. Their unwavering support, belief and shared passion for our mission kept me going even in the toughest moments. Read more: Kiztopia Marina Square Review What was your first reaction when you saw your first completed Kiztopia playground at Marina Square? It was an unforgettable moment—both surreal and incredibly emotional. After months of planning, designing, and overcoming countless obstacles, seeing the finished space come to life was overwhelming. I remember walking through the doors, taking in every detail—the vibrant play areas, the intricate designs, and the sheer scale of what we had created. It was a powerful mix of pride, relief, and excitement. But the most fulfilling part was seeing children running in with wide-eyed wonder and hearing their laughter fill the space. That was the moment I knew we had created something special. It wasn’t just about building a playground; it was about bringing joy, fostering imagination, and creating a place where families could bond. That first Kiztopia at Marina Square set the foundation for everything that followed, and even today, I still feel that same sense of excitement whenever we open a new outlet. Image credit: Kiztopia When it comes to conceptualising indoor playgrounds, what’s your go-to for inspiration? A lot of my inspiration comes from being a parent myself. I constantly think about the kind of space I would want for my own children—safe, engaging, and designed to support learning. I also travel frequently to explore different play concepts worldwide. Inspiration also comes from observing how children play, listening to parents, and staying attuned to global trends in family entertainment. Travel remains a huge source of inspiration, as seeing how other countries approach play and design sparks new ideas that we can adapt and innovate upon. Ultimately, the biggest inspiration comes from the children themselves—their curiosity, creativity, and boundless energy drive me to keep pushing boundaries. What are some places you’ve travelled to that have truly impressed you? Japan’s deep appreciation for storytelling is woven into every aspect of play, design, and experience. From iconic brands like Pokémon and Studio Ghibli to immersive attractions such as Disneyland Tokyo and Universal Studios Japan, storytelling is at the heart of engagement. Even in public spaces, interactive experiences—like teamLab Borderless and creative playgrounds—encourage imagination and exploration. Similarly, Taiwan has a strong culture of blending education with entertainment. Places like Taipei’s children’s museums and themed experiential spaces create engaging environments where kids can learn through play. The emphasis on interactive storytelling and multi-sensory experiences reinforces the idea that play should be both enriching and fun. Visiting these countries reinforced my belief that play should be more than just physical activity; it should spark creativity, evoke emotions, and leave lasting memories. At Kiztopia, we aim to bring that same sense of wonder to families by crafting experiences that go beyond play—where every child can embark on their adventure and create stories of their own. Image credit: Kiztopia I’d love to hear more about your childhood. What were your best play/playground memories? Growing up in Xi’an, my childhood was all about outdoor adventures. There weren’t many structured playgrounds, so my best memories were of running freely in open spaces, climbing trees, and making up games with friends. I especially loved visiting parks with vast green fields, lakes, and winding trails—places that felt endless and full of possibility. Nature played a huge role in my childhood. Some of my fondest moments were hiking with my family, breathing in the fresh air, and taking in the beauty of the landscapes around us. Those experiences instilled in me a deep love for exploration and adventure. They taught me that play wasn’t just about having fun—it was about discovery, creativity, and creating lifelong memories. How would you describe your parenting style? I’d say I’m a mix of hands-on and giving them space to grow. I believe in setting strong foundations, but also allowing my children the independence to make their own choices and learn from them. Encouragement, trust, and open communication are at the heart of my approach. What are some of your favourite rituals with your family today? No matter how busy my schedule gets, I try to carve out dedicated family time. Weekend breakfasts are a cherished tradition where we slow down and connect. Traveling together is another highlight, allowing us to bond and create memories. And, of course, play remains a part of our lives—whether through board games, outdoor adventures, or simply sharing laughter at home. Having a mum who owns and builds indoor playgrounds, do your kids consider themselves the luckiest in Singapore? They certainly have fun testing new playground features and being the first customers at Kiztopia. But to them, I’m simply ‘mum.’ Their joy and excitement remind me daily why I started this journey—to create spaces where families can bond and children can flourish. Read more: Best Indoor Playgrounds In Singapore Image credit: Heidi Tian What are some things you hope your children learn from you when they grow up? I hope they develop resilience, a strong work ethic, and the courage to pursue their dreams. More than anything, I want them to understand the value of kindness, humility, and always staying grounded, no matter how successful they become. Throughout your journey of juggling entrepreneurship and motherhood, what are some surprising things you’ve learnt about yourself and parenthood? I’ve learned that I’m much stronger and more adaptable than I ever thought. Motherhood and entrepreneurship both require resilience, patience, and the ability to handle unpredictability. I’ve also realised the importance of embracing imperfection—there’s no perfect way to do either, and that’s okay. Running Kiztopia has given me a deeper appreciation for the way children learn and grow through play. One surprising insight is how differently every child engages with play—some seek adventure, others prefer quiet observation, and many thrive through social interaction. It has reinforced my belief that there’s no “one-size-fits-all” approach to parenting; instead, providing the right environment and opportunities for kids to explore at their own pace is key. Quickfire questions: I wish I had more time for… Unplugged family time—just being present without distractions. And maybe catching up on sleep! I always feel saner after… Enjoying a quiet coffee, taking a walk with my husband, or sharing meaningful conversations with my kids—simple moments that remind me of what truly matters. As a mama, I wish I were better at… Letting go of the small stuff and staying fully present. It’s easy to get caught up in work, but children grow up in the blink of an eye! I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about… New ideas for Kiztopia, upcoming projects, and how best to prepare my kids for the future. My favourite moment of the day is… Winding down with my family—whether over dinner or a casual chat. Those little moments mean everything. Read our past That Mama interviews here .

Beyond NYAA, another student-led initiative, Middleton Reads, has been started by Grade 12 student Shalibeth Tiffany. The sustainable book-sharing platform is inspired by a simple yet powerful question: “What if students could get the books they want from fellow readers?” Designed to promote reading and reduce waste, the initiative enables students to exchange books within the school community. The school quickly embraced the idea, providing promotional support, mentorship, and a dedicated on-campus space to house the book exchange. What began as a personal project has blossomed into a vibrant, school-wide literacy movement. Fuelled by its success, Shalibeth expanded the initiative into School Reads and SG Reads. Her story has even been featured in the news!

Each trip is designed to broaden perspectives, foster empathy, and encourage students to discover the world around them. During the trip to Northern Thailand, students visited an orphanage, taught English at a local school, explored the famed Tham Luang Caves, and cared for elephants at an Ethical Elephant Sanctuary. Students also enjoyed breathtaking hikes, bike rides, zip lining, waterfalls, and a visit to the Night Market. More importantly, students gain a deeper understanding of their role in healing the world. In Vietnam, students spent time at the Village of Hope, where they painted classrooms, planted gardens, and worked alongside local children and teachers to improve the school environment. It was a heartwarming exchange of cultures and kindness, made even more memorable by creating handmade gifts for the children they met. These overseas trips are a reflection of SMMIS values – teamwork, global citizenship, community responsibility, and service. For students who remain in Singapore, they take part in service-learning experiences. From sports to the arts, students engage in local initiatives that build leadership, empathy, and a strong sense of social responsibility. Last year, they partnered with Waterway Watch to clean up local waterways and participated in inclusive sports activities, learning how young people with physical challenges experience play and competition.

Whether you want to go outdoor glamping on the East Coast, Sentosa, Lazarus Island, indoor glamping or even glamping at the zoo, here’s our guide to glamping in Singapore with fairy lights, plush mattresses and even air-con! Glamping in Singapore is basically super posh camping! If you’re keen to take the kiddos camping but just can’t deal with setting your own tent up, or sleeping on a hard surface with no aircon, then you’ll want to try glamping! It combines the wonders of sleeping outside with the creature comforts of a chalet or hotel staycation . Glamping in Singapore is a unique way to spend the night outdoors, whether for a big birthday party , a romantic getaway, or good old-fashioned family bonding. Check out our roundup of all the best spots to take the kids glamping in Singapore! Read more: Best Kids’ Activities & Things To Do In Singapore What does it mean to go glamping? Glamping is a word blend of “glamorous” and “camping” — taking all the fun of camping in a tent but elevating the experience. It’s basically a more glamorous form of camping that includes already set up tents, often proper beds or plush mattresses, electricity (and sometimes air-con!), cushions, picnic tables and at one glamping spot a BBQ or pizza offer! How is glamping different to camping? Glamping is definitely a more comfortable experience! But if you’re keen to teach the kids how to set up a tent, make your own food on a campfire, and rough it for the night, glamping won’t quite cut it. You’ll defo get a better night’s sleep glamping though! As with proper camping, when you go glamping in Singapore you’ll still need to apply for an NParks camping permit for free . How much is glamping in Singapore? Glamping in Singapore is not as cheap as camping but more affordable than a hotel stay. The cheapest outdoor glamping we found is from $210 per night for 2 pax, and the most expensive glamping at Singapore Zoo is a whopping $1,699 per tent! Read more: Pulau Ubin Camping Trip with Kids!

      "content": "i Light Singapore 2025 (29 May – 21 June 2025) returns to Marina Bay and neighbouring precincts and features IG-worthy interactive art and multi-sensory light experiences! Read on for what to expect. The highly anticipated annual event, i Light Singapore 2025, is back at Marina Bay, South Beach, Raffles Place, the Singapore River and more, from 29 May – 21 June 2025. This SG60 edition is specially designed around the theme of To Gather and features the colour red, in celebration of SG60. 17 new light installations and an array of activities will aim to unite people from all backgrounds and generate conversations for a more sustainable future through eco-friendly habits . Like its previous editions, you can expect plenty of creative artwork, exciting programmes and dazzling light displays. i Light Singapore 2025 highlights 1. Illuminated garden with 300 flowers Image credit: i Light Singapore 2025 The name Take a walk through the meadow with me speaks for itself. This i Light Singapore 2025 art installation by Singapore artists Megan Tan and Shao Xuan features over 300 illuminated flowers, all made from acrylic waste from fabrication studios and workshops. Take your time to explore this whimsical meadow; we hear the flowers will even say “hello” with light and music! Location: The Lawn beside the NTUC Building 2. Piano Walk, where you can make music Image credit: i Light Singapore 2025 Another interactive light installation at i Light Singapore 2025 is the Piano Walk by Amigo & Amigo from Australia. Step on the piano keys and get as creative as you like. The installation will automatically play an original composition every 10 minutes, based on all your steps! Location: Event Plaza by the Marina Bay waterfront 3. Elementary: An interactive screen Image credit: i Light Singapore 2025 This one’s sure to be a hit with the little ones. Elementary by Tonoptik from Montenegro may look like a normal flat screen. But move around in front of it and observe how your movements transform the virtual landscape of the screen. It’s inspired by the ocean and represents the human relationship with the unpredictable rhythm of nature. Pretty deep! Location: Clifford Square (next to Fullerton Bay Hotel) 4. Urban Oracle: Light reflections on water Image credit: i Light Singapore 2025 This one’s a really cool use of AI. Urban Oracle by Italy artist Ultravioletto uses the reflection of the water to highlight AI-generated messages from 24 illuminated letters. Press one of the three buttons along the boardwalk to find messages inspired by the past, present and future of Singapore’s past. Location: Pontoon near Red Dot Design Museum 5. Reverse Waterfall: Gravity-defying water Image credit: Nicole Ang This one doesn’t need much explanation, but is definitely worth a look. After all, it is a waterfall flowing in the reverse direction! Take time to observe it; the artist UxU Studio from Taiwan (presented by UOB) intend for festival-goers to reflect on what really is “natural”? Location: UOB Plaza, by the Singapore River 6. Bridge of 1,000 Dreams: Illuminated bamboo sticks Image credit: Nicole Ang Also presented by UOB and DesignSingapore Council, the Bridge of 1,000 Dreams transforms the Cavenagh Bridge into a feast for the eyes with bamboo sticks illuminating it. It’s meant to represent how Singaporeans dream of a future that’s stronger. Location: Cavenagh Bridge along the Singapore River 7. The Guardians: Inflatable garden Image credit: Nicole Ang Another one the kids will love! The Guardians is an inflatable garden that’s incredibly Instagrammable. Australian artists Matthew Aberline and The Beautiful and Useful Studio are putting Singapore’s amazing flora on display, and this one’s certainly a show-stopper. Location: Raffles Place Park 8. Saulux: Light installation with sound Image credit: i Light Singapore 2025 Saulux isn’t just any ol’ light installation; it creates an “auditory experience” with the wind transforming willow twigs into light and sound. So, be sure to listen out for the magic when you encounter this installation by SPACES.STUDIO from Malta. Location: Fountain Plaza, South Beach 9. This is Not a Screen: Made from digital waste Image credit: i Light Singapore 2025 This is Not a Screen invites visitors to ponder how digital technology can present different realities to each individual. Is what we see a shared perception? Take a moment to reflect on all that at this installation made from recycled electronic waste. Location: Near South Beach’s entrance to the Esplanade MRT station 10. Fantastic Planet: Larger-than-life humanoid figures Image credit: i Light Singapore 2025 This one’s probably the highlight of i Light Singapore 2025, because Fantastic Planets features towering humanoid figures that you can easily spot from a mile away. This installation by Amanda Parer aims to reframe one’s perception of scale and space, inviting visitors to think deeper about humanity’s place in the universe and our impact on the planet. Location: Along Marina Bay waterfront 11. Sign: Campfire-like installation Image credit: i Light Singapore 2025 Sign is an artwork installation by Vendel & de wolf that features a supersize “campfire” that is actually an illusion of flames. Visitors are encouraged to pause and witness the unique spectacle of fire catching light around it, invoking thoughts of igniting radical change through destruction. Location: Near The Promontory 11. In Tandem: Immersive installation by students from NUS Image credit: i Light Singapore 2025 In Tandem, created by Nanyang Technological University students Lee Si Heidi, Rae Koh, and Leela Rao (Singapore), uses biometric sensors to transform visitors’ heartbeats into synchronised light and sound patterns displayed on a glowing sphere. Location: Near The Promontory 12. Mozart: Deconstructed piano Image credit: i Light Singapore 2025 Located along the steps of The Helix Bridge, Mozart features a glowing white sphere symbolising a deconstructed piano. This interactive light installation comes alive with every footstep, generating compositions that mirror its fragmented form. Festival-goers are invited to step into the role of performer in this vibrant reimagining of classical music that highlights how disruption can spark new forms of creativity. Location: Helix Bridge i Light Singapore 2025 Programme Apart from the artworks and light displays, i Light Singapore 2025 will also feature a range of complementary activities and programmes.

Dishes include Tingkat of Memories ($36) featuring four snacks served in a traditional four-tier “tingkat”, Beef Tongue-to-Tail ($42), and Opeh Leaf Laksa Fettucine ($42), which comprises an assortment of fish, mussels, prawns, sambal and pasta hidden in an opeh leaf.

Located within Mondrian Singapore Duxton, Tribal spotlights wood-fired cooking and familiar Asian flavours. Start with scallops in homemade XO sauce ($35) or Yellowtail Sashimi ($26) tossed in a bright Sarawakian-inspired dressing of chilli, garlic and kaffir lime. Mains feature wood-fired grilled meats such as Santori Organic Kampung Chicken ($42) with an Asian twist from the Gai Yang barbeque glaze, and seafood of Kymer Amok Prawns ($38) or Octopus with sambal bajak and papaya salad ($55). We were most taken with the sides of Purple Sweetcorn ($12) and the clever Celeriac Mille-Feuille dusted with macadamia ($14) as well as signature sharing rice pots with a nasi ulam base of fluffy Thai Jasmine rice with fresh aromatic vegetables and herbs in three variants: wild mushroom, Wagyu and seafood.

This new day-to-night nightlife and culinary destination spans Levels 61 and 62 of One Raffles Place. One of the draws of this spot has always been the unparalleled views of the Singapore skyline, and HighHouse adds to the mix good music, cocktails and food. Wedge yourself in one of the plush booths or take up a window seating for breathtaking views of the Padang or Marina Bay. The menu encompasses small and large sharing plates such as Seafood Kokoda Ceviche, Whole Spanish Dover Sole and Sakura Pork Belly in Massaman Curry served with Sticky Rice. HighHouse , 1 Raffles Place, #62-01, Singapore 048616, highhouse.sg Fireside: New restaurant at Quayside Isle Image credit: Fireside Quayside Isle Fireside is a new restaurant bar concept by Panamericana, located in Quayside Isle, Sentosa Cove. There’s an alfresco seating area streetside but you’re going to want to head upstairs to the main bar to sink into the plush seats overlooking the yachts or perch up at the glitzy cocktail bar that takes centre stage. The menu is designed with Small and Big plates so you can tuck into something hearty for lunch or dinner—think Beer Battered Snapper with Triple-Cooked Chips ($32), Whole Chicken ($52) or Australia Black Angus Ribeye, MBS 6+ 300g ($98) but we reckon this spot lends itself best to cocktails and bites. Whatever you do, don’t leave without trying the excellent Spice Spice Marg ($22) a heady cocktail of Codigo Blanco Tequila, Codigo Mezcal, Jalapeño and Cucumber juice, best washed down with the Sea Bream Crudo ($24) and Panamericana Sourdough ($8). If you’re in need of a private room know that they have an exclusive Tasting Room with a karaoke system and projector for those late-night lock-ins. Fireside , 31 Ocean Way, #01-15 Quayside Isle, Singapore 098375, www.fireside.sg Chicco Pasta Bar: New Italian restaurant Image credit: Chicco Pasta Bar Chicco Pasta Bar is a buzzing new restaurant on Telok Ayer Street. It’s the new casual Italian spot by Australian-Italian Chef Drew Nocente of the upmarket restaurant Cenzo. At a weekday lunch this spot is crammed with hungry diners drawn by the affordable pricing and the lure of housemade pasta. Rigatoni with Guanciale, Egg & Pepper is just $18; Spaghetti with Clams and Pancetta is $18 while the priciest pasta on the menu is Mafaldine with Spanner Crab is $24 (and it’s well worth ordering!). As well as hearty plates of pasta there’s ‘Italian street food’ of Roasted Cauliflower with garlic chilli, Calamari Fritti and meatballs. At lunch there’s Housemade focaccia to mop up your pasta sauce, while at dinner Grill items are available from Australian Grass-fed Rib Eye to Lamb T-Bone. The Pistachio Tiramisu is worth saving room for. Chicco Pasta Bar , 208 Telok Ayer Street, Singapore 068642, chiccopasta.sg EDITOR’S PICK! Liberty Singapore: New smokehouse restaurant Image credit: New restaurant smokehouse Liberty Singapore Liberty Singapore is a new smokehouse restaurant in the CBD. This HK import blends Asian cuisine cooked with wood-fire techniques of a Texas-style barbecue. The menu has a fun East-meets-West vibe. Think Korean kalbi-marinated whole rib ($32/100g) smoked for 12 hours in cherry wood then slow-cooked and served with spring onion salad. Other dishes not to miss include the Short-Rib Dumplings ($22) in black vinegar and crispy chilli sauce, Prawn Tagliatelle ($32), the lighter Hamachi ($28) with mango Ponzu salsa, and the fun Corn-Rib ($16). This Whole Mexican white corn is fried, tossed in butter and curry spices — best eaten with your hands and dipped in the accompanying smoked hollandaise sauce. Image credit: New restaurant smokehouse Liberty Singapore If you have a sprout hater, order the Korean-inspired Noccham sauce brussels sprouts ($12), and they’ll soon be converts. And leave room for dessert of Apple Pie ($14), served with a scoop of 5 Spice Smoked Ice-Cream and a drizzle of caramel.

Kunthaville: New Sri Lankan Restaurant Image credit: new restaurant Kunthaville Singapore only has a handful of Sri Lankan restaurants, so we were excited to hear about the opening of Kunthaville. Housed in a century-old colonial-style conserved shophouse, Kunthaville offers Ceylonese fine dining. The owner, self-taught cook, Kuntha, has a family tea estate in Sri Lanka and has been selling Ceylon tea since 1867. The Sri Lankan fare here revolves around the Ancient belief of the six facets that balance life… sweetness, bitterness, astringent, spiciness, saltiness and sourness. Unlike many other Sri Lankan restaurants, some dishes are plated individually rather than sharing style. Starters range from spicy Beetroot Cutlets ($12) with mango avocado salad to Roasted Butternut Pumpkin soup with ginger and turmeric. Image credit: new restaurant Kunthaville: Coconut Rice, Jack Fruit Curry, Green Beans, chambals | Gundappam A real highlight is the Gundappam ($14, pictured) made from fermented rice batter. These mini appams are spongier than the usual appams or hoppers making them fun to dip into the Coconut Chambal ($14). The main of Coconut Rice is accompanied by Dry Jack Fruit Curry, Green Beans, and a few different chambals ($28). At this point, you may or may not have noticed a lack of meaty dishes. We certainly didn’t miss it, as the flavours and textures are so interesting. Kunthaville is in fact largely vegan using coconut milk or chickpea milk instead of dairy, and there is no meat on the menu. The colonial-style setting is lovely, and we reckon this spot is worth checking out whether you have vegan friends to accommodate or just fancy some delicious Sri Lankan food in an upscale setting — there’s even a yoga room upstairs should you wish to have a wellness morning followed by lunch! Kunthaville , 18 Veerasamy Rd, Level 1, Singapore 207326, kunthaville.sg Dew by Whitegrass: Michelin-starred restaurant Image credit: Dew by Whitegrass Dew by Whitegrass, is the casual off-shoot of the MICHELIN-starred Whitegrass restaurant located next door within CHIJMES. It’s all about small plates of European fare with an Asian twist to complement the sake bar. Nibble on sashimi like Chef Smoked The Salmon and Hamachi On The Way ($22) and tuck into morsels of brioche topped with prosciutto and stracciatella cheese ($15). Other highlights include Hokkaido scallops with pickled tartar and lemon garlic soy sauce ($26) or for something heartier, the Yuzu Kosho Seaweed Pasta ($20). If you’re feeling flush, plump for one of the signature luxe items, the “R” IGA Ribeye, roasted IGA wagyu A4 rib eye with sauteed spinach and wasabi ($58). Swap your usual glass of vino for one of the curated selections of Sake labels, sourced directly from different prefectures in Japan.

Ginkyō by Kinki: Cosmopolitan Japanese cuisine Image credit: New restaurant Ginkyō by Kinki If you love Kinki Restaurant + Bar at Customs House, you’re going to want to know about Ginkyō [pronounced as ‘Geen-keo’] by the same group at the new mall One Holland Village. Ginkyō redefines the Japanese dining experience with dishes that are primarily Japanese but with a cosmopolitan twist. Highlights for us were all from the Raw kitchen — featuring seafood from Tokyo’s iconic Toyosu Market (Kinki fans never fear their signature Rock & Roll makis, which are on this menu too). Image credit: New restaurant Ginkyō by Kinki Start with the cute bite-sized Ginkyō Crispies like the Uni, Caviar, Ikura ($22) on crispy rice with edible gold flakes, the filling Kimchi Onigiri Arancini ($14) made with breaded fried rice balls stuffed with gorgonzola and kimchi aioli, then definitely order the Swordfish Ceviche ($19) of beautifully cut fish, avocado and piquant salsa, served alongside crispy rice crackers. There are plenty of meaty options from Hamburg Wagyu to yakitori too, all best washed down with fun cocktails. Ginkyō by Kinki, One Holland Village, 7 Holland Village Way, Singapore 275748, www.ginkyo.sg EDITOR’S PICK! Fireplace by Bedrock: New Grill Restaurant Image credit: New restaurant Fireplace by Bedrock Award-winning steakhouse Bedrock has a new open wood-fired grill concept, Fireplace by Bedrock within the new pet-friendly mall that everyone’s talking about, One Holland Village. The open kitchen takes centre stage, and as the concept is open fire cooking, there are lovely woody aromas as the meats are grilled. Highlights include the Dirty Duck ($48) sous vide Irish duck rubbed in aromatic spices and then grilled, and the 6 Hours Wood-Fired Crispy Pork Belly ($35 for 200g / $48 for 300g), sous vide overnight, then slow-cooked above the grill, so the meat is tender. There’s a wonderful smokiness, and the skin is super crispy. Image credit; New restaurant Fireplace by Bedrock Come with a group and order the Wagyu Tomahawk Steak (market price) or the 8-hour Wood-fired Roasted Whole Lamb ($38 for 200g / $50 for 300g), and don’t miss the delicious starters from Blistered Padron Peppers to oven-baked Bone Marrow Toast ($28) on a house-made toasted brioche. We love that they have a proper Kid’s Menu (no nuggets here), featuring dishes like Boneless Chicken Thigh ($15) with baked potatoes.

MOXIE: Modern Mediterranean restaurant Image credit: MOXIE If you’re fans of the lush spot in Demspey, Siri House, get ready for a great new restaurant by the same team. MOXIE is a ‘Modern Mediterranean dining destination inspired by coastal culinary journeys’ in a bit of an odd spot — at the Medical Alumni Association Clubhouse just 5 minutes from Tiong Bahru. Once you’re inside though, the hanging rattan lampshades, the muted earthy tones, jute rugs and the light breezing in through wide windows framed by tropical plants, transports you to Bali (aided by a cocktail or two). Dive into sharing platters of dips and warm pitta, then move on to stunningly plated Grouper Crudo ($25) drizzled with Zhoug coulis, pickled Japanese cucumber and diced red radish. Image credit: MOXIE Little umami bombs like the Spanish salted cod Croquettes ($19) are just heavenly. For mains dig into Arugula Pesto Orecchiette cooked to perfection ( al dente but not crunchy) flecked with crab, pine nuts and pesto. Each dish surpasses the next — particular mention goes to the Catch of the Day (200g- $39) in our case Golden Snapper with browned almond butter and crispy capers. Desserts are really something too — the Moxie Mille Feuille is not overly sweet, with whipped mascarpone sandwiched with berries in filo pastry and Kataifi (shredded pastry), and the ‘wow’ dish is the Choc Mousse with hazelnut ice cream and a berry compote. One to add to your list! MOXIE , 2 College Rd, Level 1, Singapore 169850, www.moxie.sg Araya: South American Fine Dining Restaurant Image credit: Araya Araya is a new South American fine dining restaurant helmed by partners in the kitchen and life, Chef Francisco Araya and pastry Chef Fernanda Guerrero.

The Curry Club Signature: Indian restaurant & bar Image credit: The Curry Club Signature: New Indian Restaurant Bar If you’re looking for a new restaurant to impress, put The Curry Club Signature on your hit list. This swanky new restaurant bar on Mohamed Sultan Rd, run by a local Singaporean Indian family, reinterprets Indian flavours into modern contemporary small plates and sharing platters. It has a great back story — the owner Mr Raj, a former Singapore Airlines cabin crew member, started selling local street snack vadai at night markets after being retrenched to feed his family of six. Fast forward many years and his business grew to a mamak shop in 2006 and then a branch of different F&B. The Curry Club Signature is helmed by Chef Saumya Prakash, who has 17 years of culinary experience spanning India, Dubai and the Maldives. The menu is a reinterpretation of classics, repackaged in a fun way — Dosa Cone Triplets ($13) come as mini cones on a stand with fillings of podi masala and a trio of colourful gravies. Puri Bombs ($19) reimagine pani poori as little fried parcels encasing avocado relish topped with housemade pickled cucumber — a dainty, eye-catching dish that’s packed full of flavour! A standout is the Fire-Kissed Aubergine ($21), and don’t miss the FGRO Biryani ($37), a first-of-its-kind biryani experience featuring tender frog legs served with a side of refreshing beetroot raita and infused with apple wood smoke. It’s presented with dramatic effect in a closed dish that lets a puff of smoke out once served! We’ll definitely be back to try more dishes – and if the mocktails are anything to go by, the cocktails will be Chef’s kiss! The Curry Club Signature , 11 Mohamed Sultan Rd, Singapore 239010, thecurryclub.sg FURA: New Restaurant Cocktail Bar Image credit: FURA New restaurant bar FURA is all about enjoying food and drink in a sustainable and environmentally conscious way with many ingredients foraged locally or grown by hydroponic farmers in Singapore. It’s helmed by Christina Rasmussen, head forager at three-Michelin-starred Noma and Sasha Wijidessa, previously the head bartender at Operation Dagger before working in Copenhagen where the couple met. The space is intimate with the option to sit up at the counter where you can chat to Christina as she preps dishes. Go for a la carte or choose the six-course pairing menu at $145 which starts with a pretty dish called Weeds that features starfruit and foraged flowers and leaves. Next up, a delicate tart made with toasted kombu with a creaminess from blended lentils, topped with red radish — it’s a delight! Portions are small (in line with waste not want not) so after the bread and dip course you’ll be ready for the star of the show — a steaming bowl of oyster mushrooms with black garlic caviar. A la carte dishes include This Hotdog Doesn’t Need To Explain Itself ($15) where a slow-cooked carrot stands in for a hot dog, topped with mustard aioli and new pickle relish. Cocktails include the impressive Caviar Papi ($28) served with black garlic caviar and kombu ice cream or Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit ($24) made with Soka, tonka bean, peas and peas vermouth as well as a house-made butter bean koji.

It’s billed as more of an accessible brasserie but this is one fancy-pants dining establishment set in the iconic Victoria Concert Hall with its tall ceilings, low lighting and massive original colonnades. It’s a fun place to dine – think flambé trolleys (order the Whiskey flambéed Beef and choose between Angus $68 or Wagyu $110 to experience this in all its theatrical glory) and tableside service (Caesar salad). Image credit: Brasserie Astoria The menu is Chef Frantzén’s unique spin on classic brasserie fare, executed by Singaporean Head Chef and Zén alum Emil Cecil Ess. Dishes include Moules à la crème ($42), Råraka, the Swedish answer to rösti (you’re given condiments to ensemble toppings yourself), Brown Butter Waffles made with parsnips and topped with Astoria Osciétra Caviar (30g/$130), and Toast Astoria $32 (defo order this!) – a nod to traditional Swedish Toast Skagen topped with dressed Baltic prawns and Norwegian king crab.

Image credit: Noa Lounge Start with Hummus ($16), an unusual take on this dip with its addition of fresh sardines; the Noa ‘Bomba’ Crispy Meatball with Harissa and Allioli ($16), and a personal fave, the Burnt Cauliflower Salad with Dates ($23), a beautifully smoky creamy well-balanced dish. Order the basket of wraps and bread to mop up the sauces. Mains include Charcoal Grilled Salmon with ‘Chraimeh’ Sauce ($37) and the Lamb Kofta with Fava Beans and Yoghurt ($35), although portions are on the small side so you’ll need to order a feast to share as they would do in the Med. With its combo of fab decor and fun vibes (a hidden DJ space awaits for ‘ those ‘ kinda nights) we reckon this is sure to be one of the hottest new restaurants in town!

Step into Tajine and you’ll be greeted by a palm tree, soft lighting, arabesque walls, and a playlist with North African beats to set the mood. It’s best to head to Tajine with a gang so you can order a bunch of sharing dishes and still have room for the tajines and pastillas (Moroccan savoury pastry pies). Start with the Mixed Platter (from $36) featuring three or six dishes – not the usual hummus and dips but interesting sides like cooked carrot salad with chermoula and preserved lemons, ar’a m’asla roasted butternut pumpkin puree and grilled eggplant. The house-made woodfired pita and batbout (mini breads) are a must-order. Larger sharing dishes include the Couscous Royal with lamb merguez, lamb chop, spring chicken, kefta, and chickpeas or order a tajine – there’s the Poulet Citron Tajine with organic free-range chicken or the Milk Fed Veal Shank Tajine with bone marrow, prunes, apricot and almonds.

      "content": "“Parenting in Germany focuses on learning through play. Kids learn to be independent and make their own decisions–life skills difficult to teach in a classroom environment.” Oh Chyi Haur and his wife Aida Oh live in Munich, Germany, with their 14-year-old daughter. Both Chyi Haur and his wife were originally Singaporeans, but Chyi Haur became a Swedish citizen 3-4 years ago, while their daughter Chloe is both Singaporean and Swedish. The family lived in Sweden, Japan, and Indonesia before moving to Munich, where Chyi Haur worked as a Business Navigation Manager at IKEA. We chat to Chyi Haur about life in Europe and how it differs from Singapore. Chyi Haur shares how kids in Germany learn to be independent and make their own decisions, and there is more work-life balance. We hear how the family has adapted with Chloe learning first Swedish and then German within a few months of moving to each country, and how they stay in touch with their Singaporean roots and the community. Read on for why Chyi Haur can’t imagine moving back to Singapore and what the family miss most from their home country. Read more Overseas Family Stories here . When did you move to Germany and what were the reasons you decided to move? We moved to Munich, Germany, in August 2024 because of my new job with IKEA Germany. We were living in Älmhult in Sweden before this. Älmhult is the birthplace of IKEA and one of the corporate HQ locations in Sweden, where I worked previously. Your family has lived in a few foreign countries – any favourites? Yes, we have lived in Sweden for 7 years before moving to Germany. Before Sweden, we were living in Japan for 2 years and prior to that, Indonesia for 13 years. I think each country has its charm. We love each of the countries we lived in – Japan for sushi and onsen, not forgetting the Japanese efficiency, Sweden for IKEA and meatballs, nature and work/life balance and Germany also for nature and historical architecture. But if we had to select one country, it would be Sweden. We lived there for 7 years. This was also the formation years for Chloe in elementary school education. The nature there is amazing and my daughter also had the opportunity to pick up many life skills and activities (like figure skating, horse riding and piano). Chloe was able to compete in Figure Skating in several regional domestic competitions during this time. We were also able to take our boat to explore the many small islands in the lake near our house. As I work for IKEA Chloe had the opportunity to be featured in two IKEA Global video productions–the Global Launch of the BYGGLEK Collection in 2020 ,which was a collaboration between IKEA and LEGO where the video played in all IKEA stores globally–and the other was the promotional video of IKEA Museum in Älmhult . Yes, there is an IKEA Museum! We are extremely proud that a Singaporean child was involved in these two videos. Chloe in IKEA BYGGLEK Video in IKEA Store. Favourite aspect about living in Germany? Munich, where we are living now, is a big city compared to where we came from in Sweden. The convenience of living is here, e.g. malls, restaurants, etc. It’s a safe city with plenty of open spaces, and it’s family-friendly too. A big plus is that Munich is at the centre of Western Europe, so travelling to other parts of Europe is easy. In the short time we have been in Munich, we have made numerous road trips to Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and France. At the same time, Munich is close to the Alps and nature and numerous lakes and can be easily reached within an hour. There is always something fun to do as a family! Visiting Basel during one of the numerous trips while living in Germany. And the worst part? I think the frustrating part of living in Germany is the bureaucracy. Dealing with public authorities means that every “I” needs to be dotted and every “t” needs to be crossed. We have been ‘warned’ before moving, but to experience this first-hand is really frustrating. I also feel that the language barrier can be challenging. Although English is widely spoken, Munich, being in Bavaria (one of the most conservative states in Germany), people are not as receptive to speaking in English, even if they see you struggling to speak in German. Thus, it is crucial to pick up the German language quickly in order to survive in this environment. How do you think parenting (and schools) in Germany differs from Singapore? What do you appreciate most about it? Parenting in Germany, similar to many Western European countries, focuses on learning through play. Academic pressure is much lesser than that in Singapore. Kids in Germany also learn to be independent and make their own decisions within limits, and take responsibility early. Such are life skills which children learn at a young age and are difficult to teach in a typical classroom environment. There is much more work-life balance. Kids are not burdened with a tremendous amount of homework in Germany. Generous parental leave also allows parents to be able to spend more time with their children. My wife and I really appreciate such an environment. We see that our daughter, Chloe, grows up happy. This is the most important factor for us. Chloe horse riding. What do you find is the hardest part of being a parent living in a foreign country? I think the toughest part is the limited opportunity to be connected to the home country, especially our extended family in Singapore. Physical interactions with our Singapore extended family are generally limited to the summer vacation trips back to Singapore. Another aspect which we are struggling with is that, as we are also not proficient in the German language, we are not able to support Chloe in some of her schoolwork. This can be frustrating. However, our fears are really unfounded, as we can see Chloe is able to manage new languages (both German and Swedish) on her own. How do you and your partner juggle work and dividing up family roles? My wife loves to cook. She is able to prepare many delicious local Singapore dishes like Hainanese Chicken Rice, Laksa, Nasi Lemak, Lodeh, Mee Rebus, Sushi, Tempura and many more! As such, she prepares the meals at home. I do the rest. We also agree that I will monitor Chloe’s schoolwork. Is there something that you do to keep your child in touch with their Singaporean roots? Chloe is able to keep in touch with her Singapore roots through the famous Singapore food which my wife cooks and frequent video calls to her grandparents in Singapore. We also encourage Chloe to use Singapore as a reference or material in her school projects whenever possible. “Locally adapted Lohei prepared by my wife.” On raising multilingual children … It is super important that children are at least bilingual. We are happy that Chloe is able to communicate in English, German and Swedish. We are amazed at how fast she is able to pick up languages. When we first moved to Sweden, Chloe did not speak any Swedish. From when the school year started in August till after the New Year, we saw Chloe´s Swedish competency improve tremendously. Now, after moving to Germany, we also have a similar experience. Having no German knowledge when school started in September, after the New Year, Chloe is now able to communicate with her friends comfortably in German. My wife is Malay and I am Chinese. As we predominantly speak English at home, her exposure to Chinese and Malay is limited. We are trying to expose Chloe to both languages by speaking to her, but it has not been an easy journey. What is the first thing you do each time you go back to Singapore? Laksa has always been my comfort food. Whenever we go back to Singapore, I will always have a bowl of Laksa at Changi Airport. Even though it may not be the best Laksa, it is good enough for me at that point in time! As for my wife, she misses Mee Rebus and thus that will be the first meal she will enjoy when we return. What do you always bring back from Singapore for yourself and for your child? Chloe always likes Tapioca Chilli Crackers and Chicken Floss. My wife will bring back seasonings like Prima Taste, Indonesian / Malaysian seasonings. If it is during the festive period in Singapore when we go back, e.g. Chinese New Year or Hari Raya Aidilfitri, then we will also bring back kueh bangkit, pineapple tarts, love letters, etc. “Favourite pastime living in Sweden–taking our boat out for a spin.” Top five places in or around Munich you would recommend to parents travelling with kids and why. If you are travelling with kids, here are our top 5 picks to visit in Munich: 1. Deutsches Museum: This is the world´s largest Museum of Science and Technology. It also has a dedicated hands-on area for kids, plus interactive exhibits on space, aviation and physics. It also features real planes, submarines and trains for kids to explore. Definitely fun for all ages. 2. Olympiapark and BMW World: where the 1972 Munich Olympics were held. Today, Olympiapark has boat rides, playgrounds and an abundance of green open spaces for kids to run around. Next to Olympiapark is BMW World is the Global Corporate HQ of BMW, which has many interactive displays of BMW vehicles and also futuristic vehicles. 3. Englischer Garten: One of the largest urban parks in the world. It is even bigger than Central Park in New York. Families can enjoy a picnic with plenty of space for kids to run and play, and there are several beer gardens. It is also possible to rent paddle boats here. One of the quirks in Englischer Garten is definitely Eisbach River, where you can watch people surfing on a river, a unique Munich attraction! People are surfing on this part of the river regardless of the season! 4. Hellabrunn Zoo: This is a highly rated zoo. Many animals are kept in large, natural enclosures and are cageless. There is a petting zoo for kids, interactive exhibits and adventure playgrounds. The zoo is located on the banks of the Isar River, so you can enjoy a scenic walk along the Isar River after the Zoo. 5. Oktoberfest . How not to miss Oktoberfest in Munich? Families with kids can also enjoy the world-famous Oktoberfest if they are visiting in late September. There are family-friendly beer tents offering traditional food like pretzels and apple strudel. There are rides (carousels, Ferris Wheel and mini roller coaster), traditional puppet shows for younger kids, Funfair games and Food Stalls. What is the local cuisine like and do you eat out a lot or cook at home? Typical local cuisine consists of Weißwurst (or white sausage) served with Mustard and pretzel; Pork Knuckle served with Potato dumplings and sauerkraut and Kartoffelsalat (Potato Salad). We generally eat at home as my wife loves to cook (as mentioned above). On important occasions like birthdays, anniversaries or weekends then we eat out. Road trip to Paris while living in Germany. What’s the one thing you would miss about Germany if you moved away? We would definitely miss the Christmas markets. German Christmas markets are world-renowned. The Munich Christmas Market is one of the oldest and most famous, dating back to the 14th Century. The atmosphere, especially when it is snowing–the scent and aroma Glühwein (mulled wine), Bratwurst, etc, are something words cannot describe. Some of the Christmas ornaments are so unique that you cannot find them elsewhere. How do you stay connected with the Singaporean community? Since we first started living abroad, we have always made an effort to connect with the Singapore Community, either through the Singapore Embassy activities or social media groups. At the same time, we also try to help new Singaporeans moving in by offering advice and recommendations on practicalities to hopefully reduce the stress of moving to a new country. In Sweden, I was the founding head of my alma mater’s Alumni (Nanyang Technological University, NTU Singapore). I organise gatherings for fellow alumni in Sweden to connect, network and also stay connected with the University in Singapore. For my efforts, NTU Singapore has awarded me the NTU Alumni Service Award 2024. In Oct 2024, the Swedish King made a state visit to Singapore, I also shared my reflections in the Straits Times Singapore commemorating the visit. What do you dread and look forward to most if you were to move back to Singapore? I cannot imagine moving back to Singapore now. The continuous stressful rat-race culture and the hot, humid weather are something which I do not think I will be able to adapt to, especially being away from Singapore for more than 20 years now. However, the abundance of fantastic local Singapore food is something we do look forward to. Even at 2am, it is still possible to find great food–and all the 24/7 convenience stores like 7-11, Cheers, etc, what a treat! How do you think Singaporeans can benefit from living overseas? We feel that it is extremely beneficial for Singaporeans to live overseas if there is an opportunity to do so. The world is so much bigger than our little red dot. Exposure to different global cultures and perspectives may lead to better appreciation and tolerance. We will be so blinded if we are only living in our Singapore bubble, oblivious to the speed of development that the world is going at. At the same time, this can also lead to appreciating Singapore’s strengths even more (e.g. safety, public infrastructure, public transport system, strong governance, etc), which many Singaporeans take for granted.

      "content": "Looking for a gynaecologist for a routine check-up or your pregnancy and delivery? Check out these gynaes in Singapore for all your women’s health needs! Whether you need a routine check-up or are looking for an OBGYN once you find out you are pregnant, it’s so important to find a gynae in Singapore that you really trust and are comfortable with. With our world-class healthcare system, you’re likely to find some of the best Obstetrics & Gynaecology (OBGYN) care in the world. Consult our list of women’s clinics, OBGYNs and gynaecologists in Singapore to find one that’s right for you! Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Giving Birth in Singapore Jump to: – What to Know Before Choosing Your Gynae – Recommended OBGYNs & Gynaes in Singapore What to Know Before Choosing a Gynae in Singapore Which hospitals they are admitted to deliver at: Think about which ones are convenient to where you live. While most of the gynaes on our list below can deliver at multiple hospitals, they might not make it to you in time for your birth if you deliver somewhere other than near their main clinic. Costs: Consider which doctors work with your insurance. Many doctors offer full antenatal packages that cover checkups, scans, and even delivery, but it may work out cheaper to pay on an a la carte basis. Your choice of gynae: Do you prefer a female gynae or are you not fussed? Interestingly, most of the gynaecologists in Singapore considered most “ pro-natural birth ” are men! And yet almost everyone on Team Sassy Mama had a female gynae (some of our testimonials are below). Wait times . Be sure to ask around about wait times. Doctors at public hospitals (like NUH and KKH) tend to have much longer ones (we’re talking hours ). In our experience, it’s always best to try to book the first appointment of the day if you can. The nature of OBGYNs, of course, is that they can get called away to deliver a baby at any time, which then throws their appointment schedules into chaos. Support staff: Who is on your doctor’s support staff? Several gynaes on this list work with midwives who provide an extra layer of care and attention to patients and can be invaluable both during labour and in the postnatal stage. Backup partners: If your OBGYN is away when you give birth, make sure you’re just as comfortable with their alternate. OBGYNs & Gynaes in Singapore It is ok to shop around and find the doctor who you feel is the best fit for you . Our list of gynaecologists in Singapore is far from complete, but it’s a great place to start if you want an outstanding doctor for your pregnancy and delivery. Don’t forget to check out our list of questions to ask your OBGYN , and also take the time to educate yourself and have a think about what matters to you concerning interventions , birth plans , costs and more. Dr. Adrian Woodworth Closest hospital: Thomson Medical Centre One of the most noteworthy gynaes in Singapore, Dr. Adrian Woodworth has more than two decades of experience in obstetrics and gynaecology. He prioritises holistic care and has a reputation on mama forums for being friendly and remembering every patient’s name.

He is a noted specialist in high-risk pregnancies and ultrasound assessment, along with gynaecological laparoscopic surgery. Two other big selling points for Dr. Chang – he has clinics near two different hospitals (TMC and Mt. E Novena) and counts superstar midwife Kiki Porter-Wolff on his staff.

She is a highly experienced OBGYN, with more than 15 years of practice. Before joining private practice in 2010, Dr. Chee was the Consultant and Head of the Peripartum Unit, Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. During her time as Head of the Peripartum Unit, Dr. Chee has overseen the medical management of the KK Hospital Delivery Suite, with over 12,000 deliveries annually. I am a worrier by nature but when it comes to pregnancy, it just took another level. So when we arrived in Singapore and found out we were pregnant, I wanted to find an OBGYN that I could trust. With her background, I knew I would be in good hands. In addition, her calm and sweet personality was the perfect match for me. She accompanied me throughout my pregnancy, reassuring me every step of the way. The delivery went smoothly and I have recommended her to many of my friends since. Oh, and I never had to wait too long for any appointments! – Emilie Dr. Chee Jing Jye , 3 Mount Elizabeth, Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, #12-02, Singapore 228510, Tel: (+65) 6732 9882, www.drjjcheegynae.com Prof. Chong Yap Seng Closest hospital: NUH Renowned for introducing water births at NUH, Dr. Chong (often referred to as Professor Chong – he’s also Dean of NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine) has a reputation as one of the most pro-natural birth gynaecologists in Singapore. We have to say we also love his selection of natty bowties. “Professor Chong is very popular, and NUH is very busy in general, so expect long wait times (I’m talking hours). However, my appointments were never rushed, and Professor Chong was happy to answer all my questions. Professor Chong was very supportive of my birth plan, however, my little one arrived very quickly in the early hours of the morning so he didn’t make it to the hospital in time for the birth.” – Jessica Dr. Chong Yap Seng , NUH Medical Centre, Level 3 (Kent Ridge Wing), 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119074, appointment@nuhs.edu.sg, Tel: (+65) 6772 2002, www.nuh.com.sg/nuhgynae Dr. Choo Wan Ling Closest hospital: Mount Elizabeth Novena, but she is also able to deliver at Mount Elizabeth Orchard, Gleneagles and Mount Alvernia In addition to her popular obstetrics practice where she’s a huge advocate for a natural birth, Dr. Choo is well-versed in other gynaecological issues such as infections, endometriosis, fertility challenges and ovarian cysts. She also has a special interest in menopausal care and female sexual dysfunction. If you’re after a female gynaecologist in Singapore who will put you at ease, look no further. “Dr. Choo and her staff are warm, relaxed and friendly, and she is always happy to answer questions and offer down-to-earth advice. Her office was always buzzing with patients (book early in the day or you may have a long wait ahead of you), but I never felt rushed, and always appreciated her personal touch. When I was pregnant with #2, she let my then-3-year-old daughter sit with her to look at the ultrasound; to this day Maggie still compares all doctors against Dr. Choo! She was completely open to my birth plan and respectful of my desire to pursue a natural, drug-free birth.” – Kate Dr. Choo Wan Ling , 38 Irrawaddy Road, #10-30 Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre, Singapore 329563, Tel: (+65) 6262 3060, www.sog.com.sg Dr. Freda Khoo Closest hospital: Thomson Medical Centre. She is also credentialed to practice at several other hospitals, including Mount Elizabeth, Gleneagles, Parkway East and Mount Alvernia. A mother of three herself, Dr. Khoo is a gynae committed to the belief that every woman deserves quality and dedicated women’s healthcare throughout her life, from puberty till menopause and beyond. “I started out seeing Dr Freda Khoo at KKH and she saw me through my pregnancy till the birth of my second baby, and my husband and I had a wonderful experience with her. Dr Khoo doesn’t just talk to you like a doctor and an expert – she gets to “friend level.” That’s how much she shows she cares: it feels like she’s taken a personal interest in you, your family and your well-being. When Dr. Khoo left to start her own practice at Thomson Medical Centre, as much of a fan of KKH as I was, I went along with her! Dr. Khoo listens to her patients and if anything, her soothing voice alone will calm your nerves in any situation.” – Nadia Dr. Freda Khoo , Freda Khoo Clinic, 339 Thomson Road, #06-05B Thomson Medical Centre, Millennial Wing Lift Lobby C, Singapore 307677, Tel: (+65) 6259 6964, www.fredakhooclinic.com Dr. Goh Shen Li Closest hospital: Mount Alvernia.

As a first time mum, I liked that she explained what’s next and what to expect to me, as it reduced my anxiety of not knowing what’s to come for labour. She gave useful advice and tips on birth preparation and also respected my wish for a natural birth. Check-up sessions were always a breeze – I didn’t have to wait for long hours. She was very responsive during my panic call in the wee hours before labour. Post labour, her stitches were clean and I healed well.” – Atikah Dr. Jasmine Mohd , 339 Thomson Road, Thomson Medical Centre, #01-01, Singapore 307677, Tel: (+65) 6253 4122, www.wcca.com.sg Dr. Kelly Loi Closest hospital: Mount Elizabeth (Orchard) A mother of three with a special focus on fertility treatment, IVF and surgery in addition to antenatal and obstetrics care, Dr. Loi was educated in the UK and did further training at some of the top hospitals in the United States.

As a first-time mama, I was clueless a lot of the time, but she helped explain anything I had questions on. She didn’t impose anything on me that I wasn’t open to, and she was very respectful of my plan for a natural delivery without pain relief. Since she was at her other clinic in Jurong , she was absent during a portion of my active labour period but came just in time to deliver the baby. I’m very happy with her service overall! However, due to her popularity, I usually had to wait before seeing her for my appointments – at times it took up to half a day of waiting.” – Syazana Dr. Vanaja Kalaichelvan , NUH Medical Centre, Level 3 (Kent Ridge Wing), 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119074, appointment@nuhs.edu.sg, Tel: (+65) 6772 2002, www.nuh.com.sg/nuhgynae We’ve got plenty more pregnancy and baby must-knows you’ll love!

      "content": "Looking for a student care centre in Singapore to make sure your child is well taken care of after school with academic help, enrichment and activities? Here’s our guide, including info on subsidies, locations and student care fees While preschool and kindergarten-aged children have childcare centres , primary school and lower secondary school-going children have student care centres. Student care centres provide safe, conducive environments for children who don’t have care arrangements at home during after-school hours or school holidays . At student care, children get to fill their afternoons with holistic activities and after-school programmes and more importantly, complete their homework so they won’t have to do it in the evenings at home! In addition, student care centres provide meals. On top of homework supervision and meals, different student care options provide after-school programmes like music, sports, outdoor play and field trips! Types of student care centres All MOE primary schools have a school-based student care centre. These school-based student care centres make it easy for kids to go from their classrooms to student care without leaving the school! Only children from primary school can enrol in the school’s student care. If your child is already enrolled in a primary school, you can check with the school about the student care application procedure and criteria during orientation or at any time after your child’s confirmed enrolment. A few main operators of school-based student care include NASCANS, Pro-Teach, Big Heart, YMCA, Morning Star and Commit Learning. Community-based student care centres If the school-based student care is fully subscribed, you can consider a community-based student care centre near your home or your child’s school. This could mean your child will have to head to the student care centre themselves, but it also gives them the chance to meet and make friends with children from other nearby schools, widening their social circle. How much are student care fees in Singapore? Student care fees start from $200 per month. You’re likely to pay less if you qualify for certain subsidies at MSF-registered student care centres under the Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) scheme. Check your eligibility here.

Forum the Shopping Mall , 583 Orchard Rd, Singapore 238884, www.forumtheshoppingmall.com.sg 21. The Fullerton Hotel Singapore Location: Level B1 (near the restrooms by the foot of the staircase) Options in the CBD are few and far between, so if you find yourself on the Northern/Eastern side of Raffles Place this may be your best bet (of course, we suggest purchasing a coffee or a trinket from the gift shop if you’re not already there for a lovely afternoon tea or brunch !). Amenities include a hot and cold water dispenser, power points, a fold-down changing table and a separate nursing alcove (NB: we’ve also nursed in a comfy chair in the larger women’s restroom on B1). The Fullerton Hotel Singapore , 1 Fullerton Square, Singapore 049178, www.fullertonhotels.com/the-fullerton-hotel 22. Great World Location: Levels B1, 1 and 2 Great World’s baby care room is bright, colourful and comfy, with plenty of privacy and facilities such as a basin, hot water dispenser, diaper changing stations and nursing rooms. The nursing rooms can be locked, and have a cosy armchair and table, too. Great World , 1 Kim Seng Promenade, Singapore 237994, shop.greatworld.com.sg 23. Harbourfront Centre Location: Levels 2 and 3 (Lobby A) This is a pretty old shopping centre, so it’s no surprise its family rooms aren’t very impressive, but they have all the basics and are often much less busy than the nursing rooms in neighbouring VivoCity! Expect changing tables, private feeding areas, as well as hot and cold drinking water. Harbourfront Centre , 1 Maritime Square, Singapore 0992531 www.harbourfrontcentre.com.sg 24. Hougang Mall Location: Levels 2 and 5 (near restrooms) Nursing rooms have armchairs (no locks; separated by curtains), changing stations, sinks, hot and cold water dispenser and power points.

IKEA Location: The baby care room is located near the restaurant IKEA’s baby care rooms feature some of its own products with a minimalist but functional design, plus those famous white high chairs to keep bub safely strapped in while you re-pack that diaper bag! Bonus: you can get free jars of baby food upon request and there are microwave ovens for warming up milk at the restaurant, too! Other must-haves include a waiting area, nursing cubicles, changing tables, sinks, water dispensers, bottle warmers, and a disposable diaper dispenser. IKEA , three locations in Singapore including Tampines, Jurong East and Alexandra Road, www.ikea.com/sg/en 26. IMM Location: Level 2 (behind Kohong Health Care Centre and near OSIM); Level 3 (near car park entrance) Rejoice if you’ve got a pram with you because there is plenty of space for prams and daddies! In addition to lockable family rooms with nursing and changing areas, the nursing rooms here have baby holders to prop older babies up, power sockets and sinks. IMM , 2 Jurong East Street 21, Singapore 609601, www.capitaland.com/sg/malls/imm/en.html 27. ION Orchard Location: Levels B4, B3, B1 and Levels 3 and 4 ION has some of our favourite restrooms in Singapore so it’s little wonder that their nursing rooms are just as nice. In addition to standard amenities like a hot water dispenser and changing tables, on B3 and B4 you’ll also discover a bottle warmer and handy diaper vending machine if you find yourself in a pinch (has definitely happened to us on more than one occasion)! We also like that these rooms have plenty of room for a stroller. Other amenities include a hot/cold water dispenser, cushioned changing tables, bottle warmer, diaper vending machine and separate nursing alcoves. Their baby rooms can only accommodate one family, but you can lock the entire room and have it all to yourself. I ON Orchard , 2 Orchard Turn, Singapore 238801, www.ionorchard.com 30. JEM Location: Level B1, Level 3 and Level 5 and the family toilet on Levels 2 to 5 Spacious and clean, these are truly family care rooms with child-sized toilets for your older bubs! There are three spacious lockable nursing rooms with armchairs and a small table, as well as three diaper changing stations (the changing table is at the family toilet on Level 2), a sink, hot and cold water dispenser, bottle warmer, children’s loo and power points. The family toilet includes a children’s loo and baby holder. JEM , 50 Jurong Gateway Rd, Singapore 608549, www.jem.sg 31. Jewel Image Credit: Jewel Location: every level from B2 to Level 4 We just have to rave about the nursing rooms at Jewel because it is one of the most spacious, clean and beautifully designed nursing rooms in Singapore. There are padded diaper changing stations, hot and cold water dispensers, and private cubicles for nursing your little one in peace. There are even charging outlets for your phone in case you end up being nap-trapped when your little bub falls asleep in your arms! Jewel, 78 Airport Boulevard, Singapore 819666, www.jewelchangiairport.com 32. Junction 8 Location: Level B1, 1, 2 and 3 In addition to complimentary baby stroller rentals, Junction 8 also has two lockable nursing rooms with chairs and a small table, a changing station, a bottle warmer, a high chair and more. Junction 8 , 9 Bishan Pl, Singapore 579837, www.capitaland.com/sg/malls/junction8/en.html 33. Jurong East Bus Interchange Image Credit: Hegen via Facebook Location: Jurong East Bus Interchange This beautiful, calming nursing room was created by a partnership between Tower Transit Singapore (TTS) and Hegen. There’s a padded changing table, sink, hot and cold water dispenser and a nursing room with a lock (and a comfy nursing chair!). Jurong East Bus Interchange, 17A Jurong Gateway Road, Singapore 608513, www.towertransit.sg 34. Jurong Point Location: JP1, Level 3 (near Kopitiam), JP2 Basement 1 (opposite Samsung) and Level 3 Mongkok Street The Jurong Point nursing rooms are decently sized with padded diaper changing stations, a sink, hot and cold water dispenser and a nursing room (only on Levels 2 and 3). Jurong Point, 1 Jurong West Central 2, Singapore 648886, www.jurongpoint.com.sg 35. KINEX Location: Level 2 The nursing room at KINEX is clean, bright, and modern with three locked nursing rooms, a comfy waiting area for family, and plenty of room for parking strollers. We deem this the best nursing room in the East; it’s exceptionally clean and tidy, with three handy, private nursing stalls as well as multiple changing rooms and plenty of room for multiple strollers. Amenities include a hot/cold water dispenser, power points, cushioned changing tables, three separate nursing alcoves with comfy chairs and shelves, three lockable nursing cubicles with comfy chairs, sinks and a bench for those waiting. KINEX , 11 Tanjong Katong Road, Singapore 437157, www.kinex.com.sg 36. Mandarin Gallery Location: Level 2, Level 3, Level 4 near restrooms Key amenities include a nursing area with a sofa (the entire room can be locked), a changing table and a sink. Mandarin Gallery , 333A Orchard Rd, Singapore 238897, www.mandaringallery.com.sg 37. Marina Square Location: Level B1 and Levels 1 to 3 (near restrooms) What will you find here? Think lockable nursing rooms with sofa, a changing station and sink, hot/cold water dispenser, power points and a waiting area. Marina Square , 6 Raffles Blvd, Singapore 039594, www.marinasquare.com.sg 38. Marina Bay Link Mall Location: Level B2 There’s nothing particularly special about this nursing room except that it’s in the basement of a mall connected to one of Singapore’s biggest office buildings – we’ve had a few working mama friends who’ve pumped in the Marina Bay Financial Centre at lunchtime. It’s too small to fit a pram, but it does have a seat for nursing, a fold-down changing table, a sink, and the all-important power point. Marina Bay Link Mall , 8A Marina Blvd, Singapore 018984, www.marinabaylink.com.sg 39. Millennium Walk Location: Level B1 (next to lift lobby B) These two nursing rooms aren’t the fanciest, but we like how bright and spacious they are, with plenty of room to park strollers. There are also two toddler high chairs in case you’ve got multiple kiddos in tow and one is hankering for a different kind of snack! Amenities include power points, separate nursing alcoves, toddler chairs and cushioned changing tables. Millennia Walk , 9 Raffles Blvd, Singapore 039596, www.milleniawalk.com 40. National Gallery Singapore Location: One nursing room per floor on level B1, and levels 1 to 5 The nursing rooms at National Gallery Singapore are particularly sleek, and you’ll find one cosy nursing room per floor (that’s six in total!). Each has a comfy chair and enough room for a stroller – except on Level 5, which only has a small stool, and no sofa – as well as a hot/cold water dispenser, power points, cushioned changing table and sink. And while the nursing rooms have step-free access, they are not wheelchair accessible. National Gallery Singapore , 1 St Andrew’s Road #01–01 Singapore 178957, www.nationalgallery.sg 41. NEX Location: Level B2 (near Holland & Barrett and Jean Yip Lifestyle); Level B1 (near MoneyMax); Level 1 (near G2000); Level 2 (near Isetan and Giordano); Level 3 (near Isetan and QB House); Level 4 (near Food Junction); Sky Garden (near the Serangoon Public Library) A nursing room with a Yakult vending machine to distract older bubs? We’re loving the convenience! Other bonus points include two lockable nursing rooms with chairs, sink, hot and cold water dispenser, power points and high chairs. NEX , 23 Serangoon Central, Singapore 556083, www.nex.com.sg 42. Ngee Ann City Location: Level B1 (inside female restroom); Level B2 Ngee Ann City’s nursing rooms are functional but minimal, so head over to the nearby Takashimaya baby care room (see entry no. 63) if you’re looking for a premium nursing room experience. The nursing room here has an armchair and a table, a changing table and sink. Locks and power points are only available in the rooms on Level B2. Ngee Ann City , 391A Orchard Rd, Singapore 238873, www.ngeeanncity.com.sg 43. Northpoint City Location: B2 to Level 3 (North Wing) and B2 to Level 2 (South Wing) The nursing rooms are fitted with a small armchair and table. You can lock the door for privacy. The rooms also have changing stations, a sink and a hot/cold water dispenser. Power points are available, too. Northpoint City , 930 Yishun Ave 2, Singapore 769098, www.northpointcity.com.sg 44. One Raffles Place Location: Level 4 (next to restrooms) We hear horror stories about workin’ mamas lining up to pump here – the only nursing room in the heart of Raffles Place (we know offices should all have their own pumping facilities, but sadly that just isn’t the case right now). That said, for mamas who find themselves needing to pump (or toting their babies around the CBD), head to Level 4 to get the job done (but try not to go at peak times like lunch!). Note that this room is also too small to fit a pram. Amenities include a hot/cold water dispenser, changing table, sink, chair for nursing and power points. One Raffles Place , 1 Raffles Pl, Singapore 048616, www.onerafflesplace.com.sg/shopping 45. Orchard Central Location: Levels 3, 4 and 7 Believe it or not, there are NO changing tables available at Orchard Central, but if you simply want to nurse, it’s got you covered! Orchard Central , 181 Orchard Rd, Singapore 238896, www.fareastmalls.com.sg/orchard-central 46. OUE Downtown Gallery Location: Level 2 The nursing room at this shiny mall and office building on Shenton Way is a welcome addition to the CBD area (though nursing rooms are still too far and few between!). Here, the nursing room is separate from the changing area, which is good for efficiency’s sake but does create some pretty tight quarters (there’s just enough space to fit a stroller into each, though). The nursing rooms also have a hot/cold water dispenser, power points, a padded changing table and sink, as well as separate nursing alcoves with one seat. OUE Downtown Gallery , 6A Shenton Way, Singapore 068815, www.downtowngallery.com.sg 47. Palais Renaissance Location: Level 2 restroom The amenities are basic – there’s one nursing cubicle with a changing table. The entire room can be locked, and you’ll also have access to a sink, child toilet and power points. Palais Renaissance , 390 Orchard Rd, Singapore 238871, www.palais.sg 48. Paragon Location: Level 3 or level 5 (near the restrooms) Paragon’s nursing rooms match the high-quality interior of the mall itself, with comfy nursing chairs and complimentary baby toiletries! Clean and spacious, these stylish, lockable nursing rooms match their upscale mall surrounds with marble appointments and comfy seating. Amenities include a hot water dispenser, power points, separate nursing alcove with comfy seating, two cushioned changing tables and diaper disposal bags. Paragon Shopping Centre , 290 Orchard Road, Singapore 238859 , www.paragon.com.sg 49. Parkway Parade Location: Basement (near Japan Home); Level 2 (next to the ladies’ washroom and 6 Elements Hair Spa); Level 3 (next to the ladies’ washroom and Robert Piano). Wow, someone put some playful thought into Parkway Parade’s nursing rooms, with toys scattered about to distract the bubs! Key amenities here include nursing cubicles with armchairs and small tables, changing stations, a sink, power points and a hot/cold water dispenser. There are also high chairs and toys on certain levels. Parkway Parade , 80 Marine Parade Rd, Singapore 449269, www.parkwayparade.com.sg 50. Paya Lebar Square Location: Level B1 and Level 1 This bare-basics nursing room is lockable and can fit one pram only. However, there’s only one nursing room on each floor, so odds are, you’ll need to wait to use it. That said, the room is clean enough for a quick feed! Paya Lebar Square , 60 Paya Lebar Rd, Singapore 409051, www.payalebarsquare.sg 51. Plaza Singapura Location: Levels 2, 3, 4 and 6 (next to the ladies’ restroom) These baby nursing rooms are nicely decorated and clean, but there’s only one lockable nursing area per baby room so you might need to wait a while. There is also a changing table inside the nursing room and outside, a sink; power points and a hot and cold water dispenser. Plaza Singapura , 68 Orchard Rd, Singapore 238839, www.capitaland.com/sg/malls/plazasingapura 52. Raffles City Location: Level B1 (next to the restrooms near Marks & Spencer and Crumpler); Level 3 (next to restrooms near PS. Cafe). The lockable nursing room has an armchair and key amenities include a hot and cold water dispenser, changing station, baby diaper dispenser, sofa and nursing rooms with an electrical point.

There’s even a special Baby Centre at Universal Studios Singapore, complete with a microwave, coin-operated dispensers for diapers and bed liners and even a cute play space for older tots. The nursing areas include either lockable nursing cubicles or curtained nursing spaces, changing stations ad tables, hot and cold water dispensers and power sockets. Resorts World Sentosa , 8 Sentosa Gateway, Singapore 098269, www.rwsentosa.com 54. River Wonders Location: Near the entrance, Giant Panda Forest, Boat Plaza and Amazon Flooded Forest. The nursing rooms have diaper-changing facilities and plastic chairs. They can be locked, and also contain changing tables, sinks and power points. River Wonders , 80 Mandai Lake Rd, Singapore 729826, www.mandai.com/en/river-wonders.html 55. Scotts Square Location: Level 2 and 3 (near restrooms) Large and new-ish, these rooms look nice but considering how fancy the mall itself is, they are pretty minimalist in terms of amenities! Key features include one lockable nursing room with a bench, sink, changing area and a waiting area. Scotts Square , 6 Scotts Rd, Singapore 228209, www.instagram.com/scottssquaresg 56. Sentosa Island Location: Festive Walk (single rooms on B1 and Level 1, double rooms on Level 1 near Osia); Galleria (three nursing rooms). We hear the best nursing facilities on Sentosa Island are at Universal Studios – see the RWS entry above! But within public areas, you’ve got a few choices with necessary amenities like sinks, power points, changing tables and separate nursing alcoves. The Galleria nursing room is a little tricky to find; it’s tucked along a long hallway behind the shops! If you can’t find the nursing rooms, just check in with the friendly ground staff for directions. Sentosa Island , www.sentosa.com.sg 57. Shaw Centre Location: Level 4 (inside Isetan children’s department) The two lockable nursing rooms have basic amenities like chairs and small tables, changing stations, hot water dispensers and power points. Want to warm your baby’s food up before feeding them? Check in with the cashier just outside the nursing room to see if the food warmer is available. There are also high chairs available. Shaw Centre , 1 Scotts Rd, Singapore 228208, www.shawcentre.sg 58. The Shoppes at MBS Location: Levels B2 (next to Club Monaco and Rasapura Masters); B1 (next to Dior and Fila Kids) and Level 1 (next to Orient Crown or Imperial Treasure Fine Teochew Cuisine) These oh-so colourful rooms (peep that bold, stripey wallpaper!) offer plenty of privacy (limited to one family per room, although we’ve shared the changing tables in a pinch), along with a handy seat where you can strap in a wiggly toddler if need be. The nursing rooms at MBS are spacious enough to fit one stroller at a time, and are nice and quiet. The nursing rooms have chairs and tables, cushioned changing tables, a sink, baby seats and more, and there are two floors per level. The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands , 8 Bayfront Ave, Singapore 018955, www.marinabaysands.com 59. Singapore City Gallery Location: Level 2 near Gallery room (accessible via glass lift or escalator from the ground floor) The nursing rooms at the Singapore City Gallery include stroller parking, diaper changing facilities, a hot and cold water dispenser, a sink and hand soap. Both nursing rooms are lockable and you can get comfy on the sofas and tables. Singapore City Gallery , 45 Maxwell Road The URA Centre, 069118, www.ura.gov.sg 60. Singapore Zoo Location: Rainforest Kidzworld, Reptile Garden and at the main entrance. Diaper-changing facilities are available at Rainforest Kidzworld, main entrance, Wildlife Learning Centre, Ah Meng Restaurant, Reptile Garden and Pavilion by the Lake.

Singapore Zoo , 80 Mandai Lake Rd, Singapore 729826, www.mandai.com 61. SingPost Centre Location: Levels B1 and L3 The nursing room here is clean but minimalist at best. There’s a sink and diaper-changing station, and a child-friendly toilet within, which is perfect if you have older kids. SingPost Centre , 10 Eunos Rd 8, Singapore 408600, www.singpostcentre.com 62. Suntec City Shopping Mall Location: Levels 1 (near the Suntec City Tourist Hub and the Adidas Store) and 2 (near Toys R Us and the Convention Centre). Clean and very spacious, the main Suntec nursing room on Level 1 offers two nursing alcoves with comfy chairs, along with multiple padded changing tables, and even a bottle steriliser. NB: The nursing room on Level 2 is much smaller, with just a single nursing seat. You can expect sinks, a bottle steriliser in the Level 1 nursing room, separate nursing alcoves with comfy chairs, a hot/cold water dispenser, cushioned changing tables and power points. Suntec City Shopping Mall , 3 Temasek Boulevard Singapore 038983, www.sunteccity.com.sg 63. Suntec City Convention Centre Location: Levels 1 and 2; Tower 3 (next to Toys R’ Us) There are multiple nursing rooms scattered across Suntec, but with it being a hub for a lot of working mamas, it’s a real shame there aren’t any power points to help with expressing milk. The nursing cubicle has curtains instead of locks, and there are changing stations and a hot and cold water dispenser. Suntec City Convention Centre , 1 Raffles Blvd, Singapore 039593, www.suntecsingapore.com 64. Takashimaya Location: Children’s Department, Level 4 This has long held the crown as the single best nursing room in Singapore, and in our humble opinion, no one’s come for it yet! Super clean, spacious, and comfortable, this family lounge has room for a whole gaggle of strollers. The five separate nursing areas each feature a comfy seat and a dedicated changing table. You’ll also find toddler high chairs (with trays!) and even a Huggies diaper dispenser. There’s also a spacious seating area with a TV where you can send bored older kiddos if need be. This room is worth seeking out if you find yourself on Orchard, and your bub needs a breather. And if – due to its popularity – it’s crowded, you’ll be relieved to know there are additional nice nursing rooms elsewhere in Ngee Ann City. Other amenities include a hot/cold water dispenser, power points and sinks. Takashimaya , 391 Orchard Rd, Singapore 238872, www.takashimaya.com.sg 65. Tampines Mall Location: Level 2 (near Lift Lobby A) Key features in the two lockable nursing rooms include armchairs, small tables and a baby holder, two changing stations a sink and a hot and cold water dispenser.

Tampines 1 , 10 Tampines Central 1, Singapore 529536, www.tampines1.com.sg 67. Tanglin Mall Location: Level 3 (baby care room near restrooms); Level 2 (diaper changing room) Spacious – with enough space to wheel in a couple of strollers – this nursing room is usually pretty jumping due to all the baby-friendly amenities nearby. The decor is slightly dated, but it’s comfortable and has all the amenities a mama could need, including nursing armchairs and a table, changing stations, sink, hot and cold water dispenser and power points. Tanglin Mall , 163 Tanglin Road, Singapore 247933, www.tanglinmall.com.sg Read more: Guide To Tanglin Mall Shopping, Food & More 68.

Valley Point Shopping Centre , 491 River Valley Rd, Singapore 248371, www.valleypoint.com.sg 72. Velocity @ Novena Location: Levels 2 (near NOVITA) Nice, clean and bright, the baby room in Velocity has everything you need, but it’s a bit out of the way from the more popular stores. The two lockable nursing rooms have a sofa, changing station, sink, and power points. There are also hot and cold water dispensers on levels 2 and 3. Velocity @ Novena , 238 Thomson Road, Singapore 307683, www.velocitynovena.com 73. VivoCity Location: Levels 2 (Lobbies Q and H) and 3 (Lobby H) You won’t be disappointed with these clean, spacious baby rooms, but, fair warning, the queues can be long during the weekend rush! There are four large nursing areas with armchairs; the one with locks and a waiting area is near the playground on Level 2. There are also changing stations, sinks, power points, and hot/cold water dispensers. VivoCity , 1 HarbourFront Walk, Singapore 098585, www.vivocity.com.sg 74.

West Coast Plaza Location: Level B1 Key features within the one lockable nursing room include a bench, changing table, sink, power points and a hot/cold water dispenser. West Coast Plaza , 154 West Coast Rd, Singapore 127371, www.fareastmalls.com.sg/west-coast-plaza 76. Wheelock Place Location: Level 1 This one is a bit difficult to get to with a stroller, with the lift to level 1 as your only option. Key features in the single, lockable nursing room include a changing table, sink and power points. Wheelock Place , 501 Orchard Rd, Singapore 238880, www.facebook.com/wheelockplacesg 76. Wisma Atria Location: Level 3 The baby room at Wisma Atria is really just a small area inside the female restroom so it’s not particularly pleasant, but it has the basics in a pinch! Think armchair and changing table (no locks), a sink and a hot/cold water dispenser. Wisma Atria , 435 Orchard Rd, Singapore 238877, www.wismaonline.com The Grandstand (closed) Location: Level 1 (near Lift 7) Located just around the corner from Dancing Crab, the nursing room here is not particularly peaceful, but it’ll do for a quick change and feed. The nursing room has no locks, but you’ll find a changing table, sink, power points and a hot and cold water dispenser, so your basic needs are covered. The Grandstand Want more help?

Visit these tuft clubs and studios for carpet tufting workshops in Singapore to learn how to tuft a rug designed by you in just a few hours. Tufting, along with other artisanal hobbies like crocheting and knitting, has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest, courtesy of TikTok. Perhaps it is the authenticity of handmade crafts that appeals to many, especially in this age of mass manufacturing. Tufting – the latest addition to viral DIY crafts ­– refers to a method of weaving textiles where yarn is looped through fabric, usually to make rugs. Rug tufting for beginners: Trending clips have made modern rug tufting look so satisfyingly simple, which is perfect for beginners. You don’t even need sewing experience to create tufting designs of every conceivable shape, size and colour. All that’s required is some patience in manoeuvring an automated tufting gun that rapidly punches needle into fabric, transforming loose threads into eye-catching designs. If you are looking for a bonding activity to do with your teen , why not join a tufting workshop in Singapore? Get ready to craft your own masterpieces at these local studios offering tufting classes. Best Rug Tufting Workshops In Singapore: 1.

However, do note wait times vary according to the number of specialists available each day: National Dental Centre Singapore National University Hospital Khoo Teck Puat Hospital National Healthcare Group (NHG) dental polyclinics SGH’s Department of Emergency Medicine (A&E) NUH Accident and Emergency Department where a Dental Officer on-call will attend to you Visiting a dentist in Singapore: FAQs When should I make the first visit to a paediatric dentist? The American Academy of Paediatric Dentistry (AAPD) recommends that you schedule an appointment at a kids’ dentist or family dental clinic within six months from when their first tooth erupts or by the age of one. However, there are also paediatric dentists who recommend visits around the age of three, unless your child has specific dental concerns. Dental experts agree that the earlier you begin this routine of visiting the dentist, the healthier their teeth, gums and mouth will be. In fact, early visits to the dentist can also help prevent cavities and tooth decay and other serious dental issues later on in life. What should I do if my child is scared of visiting the dental clinic? Several paediatric dentists have observed that parents may project their own fears onto their children. Instead of asking your kids to be brave or to not worry–these phrases can instil fear or doubt that may not have been present–let them read a book or a watch a video on visiting the dentist. This can help calm their nerves, which can also help develop healthy dental habits in the long run. You can also prep your child at home by practising how to open their mouth for the dentist or by pretending to count their teeth with a flashlight. What can we expect on a first visit to a paediatric dentist or dental clinic? It’s important to schedule your child’s first visit with a paediatric dentist, as these experts are trained to manage children in the areas of children’s growth and development, behaviour management and child psychology. Many paediatric dentists will do simple things like count your child’s teeth and offer a lighthearted introduction to the purpose of a dental visit. Some dentists may discuss your child’s diet with you and offer tips for good oral hygiene and teeth cleaning. This is also a good time to ask your kid’s dentist about any concerns you may have. Once your child is comfortable with their paediatric dentist, stick to a routine and bring them to the same dentist for subsequent dental appointments. How can I encourage good dental hygiene at home? It’s important to maintain good oral hygiene after your child’s first visit to a dental clinic in Singapore. Start by making brushing a habit twice a day. Invest in kid-friendly toothbrushes that are soft to medium in strength and teach your little one how to floss, too. The best way to cultivate good oral habits is to start by brushing your own teeth with your kids to set a good example. You can also use reward systems or turn brushing and flossing into a fun game. Positive reinforcement is always a great way to hone good dental habits. Set a routine by ensuring your child brushes their teeth at the same time and place every day, or make it part of their nightly bath time. Sometimes, letting them watch a fun and helpful video can motivate them to brush their teeth regularly. The most important way to help your child overcome their fear of the dentist is to look for kids’ dentists that take the time to explain or patiently answer any questions your child may have. Make sure your child gets plenty of rest prior to the visit, and if they are shy or nervous at the first visit, it is perfectly alright to stop and try again another day. Now that you’re prepared for your child’s first visit to the paediatric dentist, consider making an appointment at these dental clinics to keep their pearly whites shiny and bright!

Dragon Boat Festival History The Dragon Boat Festival commemorates the death of Qu Yuan, a Chinese poet and minister during the Zhou Dynasty Warring States period who was banished and accused of treason. He later drowned himself in the river when the Chu capital was captured by Qin. Legend has it that he couldn’t be saved by locals who tried to race out in boats to reach him in time. Fishermen beat their oars against the water to stop the man-eating fish in the river from devouring Qu Yuan’s body. Some say they threw cooked rice wrapped in leaves into the water, hoping that the fish would eat them instead. This legend has resulted in the celebratory Dragon Boat Festival with dragon boat races and the eating of rice dumplings wrapped in reed leaves. How to cook Rice Dumplings Rice dumplings are best eaten when they are steamed, but may also be eaten as sold from your favourite rice dumpling spot. If the rice dumplings are not eaten on the day of purchase, they should be placed in the refrigerator where they can be usually kept for up to four days. When you’re ready to tuck in, reheat the rice dumplings by steaming for 15 minutes or boiling for 12 minutes.

      "content": "Looking to give your teen a head start in university? Learn how the Advanced Placement (AP) Programme can set them up for academic success to thrive in university and beyond. Applying to international universities can be highly competitive, and giving your child a strong academic foundation could be the key to standing out. If you’ve been wondering how to help your child stand out, the AP Programme might be just what they need! But what exactly is the AP Programme, and how does it compare to options like the IB? We break down what the AP Programme is all about, and how International Community School’s (ICS) AP Programme equips students with the critical thinking, time management, and academic confidence they need to shine in competitive international applications. Is the AP Programme a better fit for my child? Got a teen excelling in certain subjects and eager to explore them further? The AP Programme offers the perfect opportunity! Students can choose courses that align with their interests and goals, challenging themselves while developing critical thinking skills. Students also get to earn college credits along the way, giving them a head start in their university journey while saving both time and money on their degree. Although the courses in the AP Programme are more college-level compared to those in the IB Programme , the amount of credit awarded varies by university and course. On the other hand, students in the more holistic IB Programme are awarded credits for high scores in Higher Level (HL) exams, with the threshold often set at a score of 5 or higher. The AP Programme is subject-specific, allowing students to choose individual courses and earn credits based on the number of AP exams taken and their scores. The AP Programme gives students more flexibility, allowing them to focus on subjects they’re interested in or need for specific university requirements, giving them a smoother transition into university life. Plus, AP courses are designed to match college-level content, pace, and exams, helping students prep for what’s ahead. How the AP Programme at ICS sets students up for success At ICS, students can choose from over 20 AP courses across STEM, business, humanities, and the arts. To keep students on track, teachers assign summer work to kickstart the year and use tools like the College Board’s AP Classroom, progress checks, and past exam questions. Regular feedback, small group sessions, and extra support during lunch or after school are also part of the well-rounded approach that ICS takes to ensure students stay ahead. At ICS, AP students have achieved an impressive average score of 4.2 out of 5, earning placements in top universities worldwide, including those in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Europe, and Australia! Courses here challenge students to analyse, synthesise, and communicate complex ideas and then nurture them into independent learners and effective time managers. Some of the high-achieving courses at ICS, known for strong performance both in exam results and student engagement, include AP Psychology, AP Calculus, and AP English Literature. Students also receive personalised guidance from counsellors to help them choose the right courses that align with their academic goals. Curious if ICS is the right fit for your child? Join their upcoming virtual open house to find out more! Join ICS’s Virtual Open Houses to enjoy a $500 waiver on your application fee!

      "content": "We encourage families to think of ways, big and small, to say thank you to your helper this May during Helper Appreciation Month. May is Helper Appreciation Month in Singapore. This celebration of helpers in Singapore is something we at Sassy Mama fully support. The idea for celebrating helpers throughout the month of May began in Hong Kong, where resident Steve Chitty pointed out the month is a natural fit given that it encompasses Labour Day, Mother’s Day and the International Day of Families. Since we began with a one-day celebration and awards ceremony in 2016 to say thank you to helpers and recognise all the amazing ways they support our families, the celebration evolved from large events to show helpers how much we appreciate them to small gestures like holding giveaways. Here’s how we began to celebrate and recognise helpers’ crucial contributions to our families, plus scroll for lots of helpful resources for your helper, from further education opportunities to Gift Ideas to show your gratitude and appreciation for all your helper’s hard work. Helper Appreciation May Education is key to ensuring helpers break the cycle of poverty. Click through below to find out about the wide range of helper education courses available across Singapore – which span financial literacy, cooking, beauty, first aid, and home healthcare. Everyone deserves good healthcare, yet sadly, many helpers receive the bare minimum of checkups without regard to dental or vision care. Our past Helper Appreciation Month partner, Osler Health, has offered free cervical cancer tests for all domestic helpers of patients. Find out more here . Plus, find out how you can help your domestic worker access basic financial knowledge and education to support her family, plan for her future and retirement, and ensure she avoids common hazards like loan sharks . Click through for information on courses and to find out more about small business success stories from AIDHA in Singapore. From the top maid agencies in Singapore to tips on onboarding a new helper or preparing your children to say goodbye to your helper, we hear from experts covering all your helper-related questions. PS: Save the Emergency Contact Card and share it with your helper and friends. Help your helper have fun on her day off with our roundup of clubs, hobbies, and activities for helpers in Singapore! The struggle to achieve a work/life balance is real for all of us! But when you work 6 days a week (and live at your workplace ) it can be even tougher. Making time for fun can make a big difference to the rest of the week, whether it’s getting some exercise, indulging a creative side, joining a club or getting together with friends. Make sure your helper knows what’s on offer for her in her spare time and on her day off. Sassy Mama is dedicated to celebrating ALL mothers and families. Here’s how we began to celebrate and recognise helpers’ crucial contributions to our families: We began with a Helper Appreciation party began back in 2016 recognising helpers for special achievements in childcare, cooking and looking after pets. Read all about how our Helper Appreciation party, see how the initiative has grown over the years, and help us continue to spread the word across Singapore!

      "content": "Check out these kid-friendly places for rock climbing and bouldering in Singapore. Want to take the kids rock climbing or bouldering in Singapore? Rock climbing is such a fun physical family-friendly activity and it’s a great way for kids to develop gross motor skills and build stamina. Need a few recommendations for bouldering (which is a form of climbing without ropes) or kids’ rock climbing? We round up a few cool spots with themed climbing walls, augmented reality areas and more! Loads of these rock climbing and bouldering gyms are also open for younger kiddos – some even host birthday parties . All you have to do is come in sportswear and bring covered sports shoes with socks. You can rent special climbing shoes if needed, along with any other necessary equipment, from the rock climbing or bouldering gyms directly. Do note that you’ll need to check minimum age/weight requirement,s and you have to factor in rental on top of rock climbing entry fees. Keep scrolling to find out all the best rock climbing and bouldering gyms in Singapore! Difference between Bouldering and Rock Climbing: Bouldering is a type of rock climbing that doesn’t require a rope or harness. Bouldering walls are thus not very high since you only climb 3-5 metres. There will usually be a soft landing pad under a bouldering wall for you to land on if you fall. You’ll need to learn the correct bouldering techniques and how to return to the floor safely. Rock climbing (also called rope climbing) requires a rope and harness, and you frequently climb more than 9 metres off the ground. With rock climbing, many centres use an auto belay – an automatic electro-mechanical or mechanical climbing belay system. It replaces the need for someone to hold your rope and tighten it as you climb, as the auto-belay automatically retracts the climbing rope, taking up the slack as you climb. Kids can easily learn how to do this, but for safety, you should check that new climbers are locked in every time they climb. With bouldering, no such equipment is needed. Our kids have found rock climbing more fun as many of the climbing walls are themed, and they like the challenge of climbing high, which you don’t get with bouldering. Also, with bouldering, to come down from your climb, you need to jump to the crash pad. With rock climbing, kids get to rappel (abseil) back down safely with the auto-belay system, which is pretty fun!

Read more: Guide to SPED Schools, Early Intervention Centres, Inclusive & Special Needs Schools in Singapore Common signs that your child may need speech therapy Communication challenges can impact your child in the long run, but how can you tell if they need professional help? While it’s important to keep in mind that children develop at their own pace, certain signs may indicate the need for early intervention. One of the most common challenges is speech delay. You might notice your child falling behind their peers when it comes to speaking or understanding language. Some children also face difficulty forming complete sentences or using incomplete phrases. Most kids begin speaking around 1 year old and start forming sentences by 2. If your child isn’t hitting these milestones, it might be a good idea to seek support. Other common signs to look out for include trouble following instructions, struggling with articulation, unintelligible speech and stuttering. Parents should also observe if their child has difficulty maintaining conversations, making friends or understanding social cues, which may be accompanied by frustration when trying to communicate. Why early detection is important Communication challenges can impact your child in the long run, making it harder for them to build self-confidence, make friends, express their feelings and even succeed in school. Early intervention is essential in helping your child communicate effectively, which in turn supports their emotional and social development. Speech therapists are beneficial at addressing these challenges and ensuring your child gets the support they need. At Ray of Joy Therapy, the team, made out of three founders, brings extensive MOE school and preschool experience, offering unique insights into the communication skills children need. Therapy sessions can be held at their One Holland Village space or at your home. These sessions are designed to help parents understand how communication skills impact children at every educational stage – from playground interactions to classroom participation – providing therapy that prepares children for real-world communication challenges.

Special education schools in Singapore (SPED) are part of a quickly evolving landscape, as 2019 marked the first year that Singaporean students with moderate-to-severe special needs were required to attend school under the government’s Compulsory Education framework . These days, younger learners and non-Singaporean students also have plenty of options for special education preschools and early intervention centres that can help differently-abled children thrive in supportive and safe environments – Singapore has 19 government-funded SPED schools, too, which you can view here . Alongside special education schools, inclusive schools, which are ‘mainstream schools’ where diverse students learn side by side in the same classroom with extra support offered, there is a notable culture shift towards neurodivergent acceptance and inclusion . Do note that there is some controversy around applied behaviour analysis (ABA) therapy to ‘fix’ autistic attributes and teach autistic kids skills to lessen problematic behaviour like self-harm. Some parents and the neurodiversity movement do not support the use of ABA therapy and instead seek out interventions that use neurodiverse-affirming approaches . As always, do your research to understand what therapy you feel would best suit your child. We discuss the different approaches here. Wondering where to find a SPED school, inclusive preschool or an early intervention programme that will suit your child’s learning needs? We’ve rounded up a wide range of special needs schools in Singapore – from inclusive schools to specialist special needs preschools and early prevention programmes – which cater to Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and non-Singaporean students of differing abilities unless stated otherwise.

Thumbs Up Therapy Singapore , 24 Jalan Kuning, Singapore 278169, Tel: ( +65) 8803 8447, www.thumbsuptherapy.sg Frequently Used Terms for Special Needs Learning in Singapore We strongly suggest checking out Singapore’s Association for Persons with Special Needs ( APSN) and the M.O.E.’s Parent’s Guide for Children with Special Education Needs , which answers the question “ What does it mean to have special education needs?” with the following points: They have been diagnosed with a disability They show greater difficulty in learning as compared to the majority of their peers of the same age (e.g. difficulties in social, language, academic or physical abilities). They require different or additional resources beyond what is generally available for the majority of their peers of the same age. Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) Commonly practised as a therapeutic intervention for Autism, ABA is a type of therapy that focuses on improving specific behaviours, such as social skills, communication, reading and academics, as well as adaptive learning skills. Do note that there is some controversy around applied behaviour analysis (ABA) therapy to ‘fix’ autistic attributes and teach autistic kids skills to lessen problematic behaviour like self-harm. Some parents and the neurodiversity movement do not support the use of ABA therapy and instead seek out interventions that use neurodiverse-affirming approaches . We discuss the different approaches. here. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Autism spectrum disorder (or just autism) is a broad range of conditions characterised by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviours, speech and nonverbal communication. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) A brain disorder marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development . Early Intervention In Singapore, early intervention programmes are defined as seeking to equip infants and young children with special needs with improved motor, communication, social, self-help and cognitive skills. Early intervention activities are designed to maximise their developmental growth potential and minimise the development of secondary disabilities. Inclusive education This is an educational model or philosophy where special needs students are in the same classroom as non-special-needs (general education) students, with the belief that it fosters understanding and tolerance and better prepares students of all abilities to function in the world beyond school. Mainstream school “ Mainstreaming ” is the practice of placing students with special education needs in a general education classroom during certain times, based on their skills (while at others placing them in separate special education classes). This is in contrast to “inclusion”. Neurotypical A relatively new term used to describe individuals of “typical” developmental, intellectual and cognitive abilities (in contrast to someone who may be on the autism spectrum or has other developmental differences characterising them as “neurodiverse”). Occupational Therapists These specialists can help children achieve developmental milestones such as fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. In a broader sense, occupational therapists work with people to help make everyday living easier. Shadow teachers Shadow teachers work directly with a single special needs student in a mainstream or inclusive educational setting, focusing on social development and any particular difficulties that might arise from a child’s specific abilities Speech Therapists Speech therapists work with people of all ages with communication or swallowing difficulties, including comprehension and expression, articulation and phonology, fluency, and voice. Speech therapists can also help kids with other issues with spoken and written language, including dyslexia, dyspraxia, and auditory processing disorder. Other Resources For Individuals With Special Needs In Singapore Autism Resource Centre (Singapore) Autism Resource Centre (Singapore) is a non-profit charity organisation that helps individuals on the autism spectrum maximise their potential in life by providing education, employment and empowerment of family caregivers and professionals. From helping families find a suitable early intervention school to offering training for caregivers, Autism Resource Centre (Singapore) is readily available to provide the support every family might need.

We love that there are direct flights from Singapore to Da Nang available daily. Flights from Singapore to Da Nang are about 2 hours and 45 minutes long on Singapore Airlines and Vietjet, no transits needed. The flights aren’t too lengthy which is a bonus if you’re travelling with young children.

The dry season in Da Nang lasts from February to May and is perfect for outdoor activities with daytime temperatures averaging between 25°C to 30°C. We love that the evenings are cool with low humidity during this time, unlike the tropical weather we’re used to in Singapore. The hottest months in Da Nang are between June and August, with temperatures hitting 40°C. The rainy season in Da Nang starts from around September and lasts till December/January. During this time temperatures will drop to around 18°C to 23°C, with the city being susceptible to typhoons.

My Khe Beach has earned a reputation as one of the best things to do in Da Nang for its powdery sand, rows of palm trees, calm waves and picturesque view of the mountains and open sea. Stretching a whopping 10 kilometres long, My Khe Beach is a great place to go with the family in Da Nang for sunbathing, sunrise and sunset, beach sports and water sports.

Ba Na Hills is located about an hour’s drive from Da Nang city, or 20 minutes if you head to the Hoi An cable car station near Ba Na Hills SunWorld and take the gondola up. That said, you’ll want to set aside at least half a day to cover all the best things to do at Ba Na Hills. First up is the famous Golden Bridge; you know–that iconic bridge held up by two massive rock hands. We recommend taking the cable car up to enjoy stunning views of the valley below. The Golden Bridge is located near the Marseille cable car station. It gets busy with tourists, so we recommend heading here as early as possible. You can then take the cable car to other parts of Ba Na Hills. A must-visit is the French village at Morin Station, and we guarantee the kids will love Fantasy Park Da Nang, which has a natural history museum with dinosaurs and arcade games–all included in the cost of your Ba Na Hills entry ticket. There’s also the Alpine Coasters ride and picturesque gardens up here. There are hotels at Ba Na Hills if you wish to stay the night, but honestly, a day trip here is sufficient.

Over here, you’ll find caves and trails, as well as towers and pagodas that date all the way back to the 17th century. All these are accented by overgrown vines and moss and marble statues that give the mountain its ancient city vibe. At the foothills of the mountain, you’ll find numerous marble shops and stalls selling souvenirs and trinkets. Just be warned: you’ll have to climb a lot of stairs. We don’t recommend bringing young kids here as it’s not stroller-friendly at all, and some of the trails are very rugged and with slippery rocks. Older kids should be able to tackle the mountains, though–they can even climb through a cave! Trust us, the amazing sights of Marble Mountains are what make it one of the best things to do in Da Nang. Marble Mountains Da Nang, 81 Huyền Trân Công Chúa, Hoà Hải, Ngũ Hành Sơn, Đà Nẵng 550000, Vietnam Dragon Bridge Da Nang: Fire-breathing dragon bridge Image credit: Wikipedia The Dragon Bridge in Da Nang is pretty hard to miss as you can see it en route from the airport to My Khe Beach. The bridge isn’t just a cool monument of the city; it’s also where you can catch the FREE fire and water show! This one’s not to be missed, because the Dragon Bridge in Da Nang actually breathes fire! The dragon fire-breathing show starts at 9pm and is about 15 minutes long. You can view it from the shores of the Han River or from the parallel Tran Thi Ly Bridge. Dragon Bridge Da Nang, Đ.

However, the show-stopper here is really the kid-friendly facilities. Over at the Camp Hyatt kids club, kids can let loose at the small indoor playground with a ball pit, lots of toys and two bouncy castles. We love that there are complimentary kids’ activities and workshops throughout the day, so you can drop the kids off and then go relax at the spa. There’s a massive playground next to the kids’ club, as well as the kids’ pool with an inflatable water playground. You’ll also find an array of fun lawn games, a rock-climbing wall and a small football field here. The resort also has a gaming arcade that’s free to use for all guests plus a vegetable garden with a rabbit coop! Kids will also love frolicking on the spacious white sand beach and you can easily tire them out just at the humongous main swimming pool (which also has a little ‘faux beach’ corner) alone.

      "content": "Children’s book recommendations for according to kids’ ages–for reluctant and insatiable readers alike! Every literary expert will tell you: the first step to getting your child to love books is to read, read and read some more. And to do that, you’ve got to find the right books to pique their interest. So, if you’re running out of ideas, we’ve come up with a list of recommended children’s books based on what they already know and love. It’s important to note that each child reads at their own pace and will differ in maturity level, so the age ranges we have included are more of a guide rather than set age restrictions. Some may find these suggestions too advanced or not challenging enough, so we’ll leave it to you (and your kids!) to decide what you think is the most appropriate page-turner for your little bookworm. Here are our favourite book recommendations by age: 4 to 7 years old 8 to 11 years old 12 to 14 years old 14 and older 4 to 7 years old If they like Peppa Pig… try Charlie and Lola by Lauren Child A natural progression from many a parent’s saviour, Peppa Pig, is Charlie and Lola by Lauren Child. Before the cartoon there were the books, and there’s plenty to choose from with 38 titles including I Will Never Eat That Tomato and I Am Too Absolutely Small to Go to School . This series is particularly great if your child has a younger sibling, as Charlie is a picture-perfect, patient, big brother to Lola and her curious and crazy ways. If they like One Gorilla by Anthony Browne… try Chu by Neil Gaiman Who doesn’t love pandas? Neil Gaiman writes for all ages – the very young, teens and adults – but we’re big fans of his series about everyone’s favourite panda, Chu. Chu’s charming adventures would be an excellent addition to your picture book collection because he’s just so incredibly cute (we can’t even) . This series is ideal for little readers, as the books aren’t too long and the delightful artwork really helps bring the stories to life for parents and children alike. If Chu isn’t already your child’s best friend, he sure will be soon. Find the series at Amazon . If they like We’re Going On A Bear Hunt by Michael Rosen try… his whole catalogue Not only does Michael Rosen create timeless, family-focused stories perfect for reading out loud, he’s also an author that really knows what little ones love to read. That’s why we’re recommending his full back catalogue. He was previously the British Children’s Laureate and a professor in children’s literature – not that this means anything to kids, mind you. But children with a cheeky streak will love his Little Rabbit Foo Foo in particular and her meddling ways in this cute poetic story which you can even sing along to. Click here to see his full author page on Amazon! 8 to 11 years old If they like Diary of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney… try Hank Zipzer by Henry Winkler Jeff Kinney’s Diary Of A Wimpy Kid has been a revelation in getting kids to read (especially boys!). This series tells the tale of Greg Heffley’s hilarious school fails as he tries to navigate being a slightly awkward middle schooler (ah, takes you back to your own school years, right?) . If your kid loves these books, and they probably already do, then we suggest Henry Winkler’s (yes, the Fonz!) Hank Zipzer series . Hank is everyone’s favourite anti-hero, struggling at school due to his learning difficulties but still trying his best to get by. Winkler himself has struggled with his own dyslexia and wanted to reflect this in his books – they’re even formatted in an easy-to-read typeface. This is a great series to give a confidence boost to any young reader struggling with their own obstacles and teaches empathy and understanding to the rest. Available from Book Depository here. If they like Roald Dahl… try Gangsta Granny by David Walliams David Walliams seems to have taken his place as the modern-day Roald Dahl. His books are even illustrated by Quentin Blake, the man behind all of the classic Dahl covers you loved as a kid. Cheeky, irreverent and wildly funny (even for adults!), Gangsta Granny – along with Walliams’ many other titles – will have your kids rolling on the floor with laughter. The gangsta granny in question is deemed the “boringest” grandma in the world, until our curious protagonist, Ben, discovers she’s actually an international jewel thief (didn’t expect that, did ya?) and she’s after the crown jewels… Find it here on Amazon . If they’re into James Bond-esque thrillers… try Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer The Artemis Fowl series by Eoin Colfer has everything an action-loving reader needs. The title character is a 12-year-old millionaire, criminal, and mastermind who decides to takes on the race of fairies to steal all their gold. Keeping up? This series is so entertaining, we think it’s the perfect choice for parents to read with their children (reading together doesn’t have to stop once they’re too big for your lap!) . We particularly love this series as it’s a brilliant introduction to more sophisticated storytelling. The dialogue is witty and Artemis is a whip-smart, complicated fellow – the definition of an antihero. So you’ll be able to have some epic discussions together about Artemis’ slightly skewed inner moral compass. Click here to see Book 1 on Amazon! 12 to 14 years old If they like Girl Online by Zoe Sugg… try Geek Girl by Holly Smale Holly Smale’s “Geek Girl” series revolves around the proudly nerdy Natasha. She is trying to survive her secondary school years with a limited social circle, while battling a nasty bully intent on making her life a living hell. That is, until she’s discovered by a modelling talent agency and her life is thrown into a whirlwind of fashion shows and international travel. This is an awesome series for girls trying to find their way; it teaches that it’s okay to be a geek and it’s okay to be a chic fashionista, just as long as you stay true to yourself (cheesy we know – but an important lesson all the same) . Available from Book Depository here . If they like Skulduggery Pleasant by Derek Landy… try Garth Nix’s catalogue In a past life, when I worked as a librarian (no jokes about cat hair and cardigans please!) Skulduggery Pleasant, the wise-cracking skeleton detective was always in high demand, especially with boys. Now in its 11 th reincarnation, it’s dark, witty and full of spine-tingling mystery and action. So, if you have an avid reader looking for what’s next after the adventures of Skulduggery, we recommend the works of Garth Nix. There’s the “Troubletwisters” series about two twins discovering their supernatural powers, which is better suited for the lower end of this age range. And for the older kids, there’s “The Abhorsen” series . Nix writes magical, dark and dramatic stories that often focus profoundly on death. There are themes of sex and drinking featured in this series, so we suggest you read them beforehand to see if they are age-appropriate for your kids. Available from Amazon. If they like The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins… try The Knife Of Never Letting Go by Patrick Ness Patrick’s Ness’ dark dystopia The Knife of Never Letting Go begins in a small town where women have been banished and only men remain (the horror!). Due to a virus, everyone can hear each other’s thoughts, an epidemic known as the “Noise”. This is the first in a thrilling sci-fi series that tackles big questions, much like “The Hunger Games”, such as identity and prejudice. Available from Book Depository here . 14 and older Parent Tip: We’re now entering the YA (young adult) genre, which can vary widely in themes, content and levels of maturity, so do your due diligence if you feel uncomfortable with your teen or tween reading beyond their age or about certain topics. If they like The Fault In Our Stars by John Green… try Sarah Desson’s catalogue Even the most casual reader knows of John Green’s sob-fest The Fault In Our Stars , so if they loved the thoughtful tone of Green’s teen mega-hit, look for anything by Sarah Desson. We particularly recommend Just Listen , which is about Annabel, the girl who had everything and then quickly lost it all. The book details how she deals with her new social status (or lack thereof) , her sister’s anorexia and the new mysterious guy in her class. It’s a thoughtful and sometimes sad read, tackling mental illness and the importance of family, listening to each other and the healing power of music. If they like Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman… try The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas This book has won multiple awards and certainly packs a punch as it depicts modern-day race relations in the United States. The main protagonist, Starr, witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend, Khalil, at the hands of a police officer and struggles to know where to turn next as the ensuing media circus and debate boils over. Big themes and even bigger discussion points here, so don’t be surprised if your teen goes quiet while reading this one — there’s a lot to mull over. Find it on Amazon . If they like The Maze Runner by James Dashner… try Gone by Michael Grant A lot of YA fiction is targeted at girls and focuses on romance, so we wanted to recommend something for boys who might be reluctant readers. Gone is certainly a page-turner and a half, similar to a Stephen King mystery with added sci-fi fantasy. In this dystopia, everyone disappears, except the young, which might sound like a dream to your teen, but with no technology (no phones?!), the threat of hunger, and no adults to guide them, tensions rise and a new world of territorial, supernatural teens arises. Parent Tip: If you’re wanting to avoid online shopping and you can’t find a particular title in-store or at your local library , then ask! Often, shops and libraries are willing to order in books but this can sometimes come with an extra cost. Check out this list of libraries in Hong Kong to find your nearest book-borrowing service.

      "content": "Here’s our guide to Coney Island in Singapore, from how to get there (it’s a park on a small island off Punggol) to where to rent bicycles, information on beaches, places to eat and Coney Island opening hours! A visit to Coney Island in Singapore has been a top family-friendly activity for its beautiful scenery, rustic beaches , (no beach clubs in sight) calm ambience and easy cycling and hiking trails ! Here’s everything you need to know to plan your trip with the kiddos, including how to get to this family-friendly park (entry is free) and closing times to Coney Island so you don’t get locked in (it’s happened before!). Jump to: – Things to do at Coney Island – Where to eat near Coney Island – How to get to Coney Island – Coney Island opening hours Things to do at Coney Island Singapore Image credit: Abigail Wright Coney Island was previously known as Pulau Serangoon or Serangoon Island, and the capacious 50-hectares island is also an ecologically sustainable park. Coney island was previously owned by the Haw Par brothers before it was sold to Ghulam Mahmood, an Indian businessman, in the 1950s. Mr Mahmood had intended to re-create the famous Coney Island of New York here but that dream was short-lived. In the 1970s, Coney Island was returned to the Singapore government and today the quiet park ironically retains the name of a famously busy amusement park. Coney Island in Singapore has plenty of rustic charm, home to a wide variety of habitats and a diverse range of fauna and flora, including several nationally threatened species. The park is favoured by more than 80 species of birds, offering visitors an ideal location for birdwatching. Explore the forest and mangrove habitats on foot or by bicycle. Be charmed by five differently themed beach areas and a variety of habitats that support beautiful free-flowering plants and critically endangered species. Things To Do At Coney Island: Cycling, Birdwatching & More: 1. Cycling at Coney Island Park: Bicycle rental at Coney Island Image credit: Abigail Wright With views that are off the beaten path, Coney Island makes for a great cycling day out! You can bring your own bikes or easily rent a bicycle at Coney Island. Once you’ve arrived at Punggol Settlement, look out for Go Cycling (find them here ), which is in the opposite direction from Coney Island, or Jomando Adventure and Recreations , which is nearer (about 200m away) to the park’s West entrance. Choose from mountain bikes, cutesy city bikes (perfect for mini photo shoots with the fam) and even bikes with trolleys just in case you’ve brought extra necessities for a family day out. Do note that there are mixed paths at Coney Island Park–some are easier to cycle on than others. If your family are keen cyclists, you can tack on a ride along the Punggol Park Connector before or after your Coney Island trip. The cycle route around the Punggol promenade is relatively short compared to other bike ride options in Singapore, as it only spans 4.2km, but it’s a really leisurely ride with great views of nature and the manmade waterway. Read more: Kid-Friendly Cycling Trails In Singapore 2. Bird-watch at Coney Island There are over 80 species of birds on the island, so if you love to look out for kingfishers and more wildlife in Singapore , wait around at the bird-watching hideout. This spot on Coney Island allows you to observe the birds in their natural environment without scaring them away. Tip: tell the kids to keep their voices hushed, else the birds will stay away! 3. Explore the Coney Island beaches Image credit: Jnzl on Flickr There are five small beach areas on Coney Island. These beaches are accessible via earth tracks, and despite their small size, the beaches are all natural! Try looking for Coney Island Beach Area A because it can be easily found from the Coney Island West entrance. 4. Snap photos amongst Coney Island’s beautiful tall trees We were really in awe of the endless tall trees and greenery all around the island, and although it seems that every other spot looks exactly the same, we beg to differ. Some areas are more forested with lalangs all around, while some are more sparse. 5. Check out the kids’ obstacle course Image credit: NParks Coney Island Casuarina Exploration is a kid-friendly obstacle course made up of timber from uprooted Casuarina trees, which have been collected and recycled into multiple features at Coney Island, including park signage, seats, benches, boardwalk and exhibits! 6. Relax by the Coney Island promenade On the western and eastern parts of the island, there are paved areas where you can lay your mat and enjoy the cool sea breeze with a view of passing ships and Johor’s shoreline. You can spend a good hour here taking in the fresh air. 7. Check out the mangrove boardwalk If you’re on the trail to Beach Area C, walk through the mangrove forest. The air is so crisp and fresh. The wooden planks are made from Casuarina trees! When you’re in this area, be extra careful, because mangroves are susceptible to high tides. Where to eat near Coney Island Singapore Image credit: Trunk 95 There are no food options on Coney Island itself. The nearest restaurant is a walk away at the Punggol Settlement, which has a number of great eateries, from cafés to casual bistros that make for some memorable riverside dining! There’s also a 7-Eleven there if you need to get essentials before or after your Coney Island Park visit. Level 1 House of Seafood Ponggol Seafood House of White Bee Hoon Southwest Punggol Level 2 Siam Square Mookata Izakaya 95 Trunk 95 Relax Bar Tandoor Lounge George’s By The Bay How to get to Coney Island Singapore By Public Transport: Alight at Punggol MRT Station and at Exit C, board bus 84 and get off at Punggol Road End. You can also take the LRT from Punggol station to Punggol Point. Head to Punggol Settlement and follow the signs to Coney Island. By Car: Programme your Google Maps to lead you to Punggol Settlement and park at the outdoor car park. Walk towards the restaurants and follow the signs to Coney Island. You can reach Coney Island by renting a bicycle from Punggol Point Park or Punggol Settlement. Cycling from here (about 500m) will get you to the West entrance of Coney Island. You can also access the East entrance of the island via Lorong Halus and Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 6. For those who prefer to take a leisurely stroll, you can do so from Punggol Point Park (although we highly recommend renting a bicycle with the family!). By Bicycle: Get on the Punggol Park Connector which leads to Coney Island Park. Other things to note when visiting Coney Island: Closures: A section of East Promenade and its toilet will be closed from 7 June 2021 to 30 June 2024 to facilitate construction works. There are alternative paths to get to Beach D and E. Alternative toilets are also available. More info here . For your safety: Box jellyfish have been spotted in Singapore waters. Do take precautions before heading to one of the beaches. More info here .

Read more: Ultimate Guide To Sentosa For Kids Always check ahead on the NParks website for beach news and updates. Best Singapore Beaches For A Day Out With The Family: 1. Palawan Beach Singapore: Popular beach in Singapore Image credit: Sentosa A definite contender for the best Singapore beach, you’ll find the sandy stretch of Palawan Beach between Sentosa’s Siloso Beach and Tanjong Beach (the closest Sentosa Express stop is Beach Station). What makes Palawan Beach one of the best Singapore beaches is its soft sand and family-friendly vibe. With ships on the horizon, it’s a pretty patch to set up for a sunny morning at the beach. Look out for the suspension bridge that connects the Singapore beach to the Southernmost Point of Continental Asia and also Asia’s closest point to the Equator. You can swim out to the island but beware; the currents are very strong so this is only advised for very strong swimmers. Safety tip for when you are at a Singapore beach: Always swim between the Red and Yellow (‘Swim Here’) flags, where the area is closely supervised by Beach Patrol officers from 9am to 7pm. Beachside dining: FOC Sentosa with a small plunge pool. Palawan Beach Singapore , Palawan Beach Walk, Sentosa Island, Singapore 098521, www.sentosa.com.sg Read more: Guide To HydroDash Singapore 2. Siloso Beach Singapore: Public beach with dining spots Image credit: Sentosa Another one of the best Singapore beaches, Siloso Beach, is where you’ll find family-friendly outdoor dining hot spots right by the water, and you can dine with the sand between your toes. The waters are relatively calm here, so it’s popular for families with young kids who can splash about in the sea and make sandcastles on the beach. This Singapore beach is cleaned regularly and is patrolled by Beach Officers who will advise when it is unsafe to swim. The restaurant, Rumours, has pools to splash out in as well as the beach right on their doorstep, so the kids can make sandcastles while you have a coffee or cocktail. Coastes is a fave, thanks to the tables on the beach set up so that you can watch the kids play while you eat. Ola offers water sports like stand-up paddleboards and kayaking for sporty teens, whilst Trapizza is great for thin-crust pizzas close to the beach. The ticketed mega-playground Nestopia is nearby as well as the nearest Cable car stop. Come dusk, the younger crowd brings more of a party vibe to this Singapore beach. There are some great kid-friendly hotels in Singapore for a family staycation located in this area, too!

Tanjong Beach Singapore: Quiet beach in Singapore Image credit: The Lo & Behold Group Some say Tanjong Beach is the best Singapore beach as it has something for everyone, depending on the time you visit. First thing in the mornin,g this pretty stretch of sand attracts dog walkers and volleyball players. Then families with young kids descend and come early afternoon the party peeps and sun-seekers move in, taking over Tanjong Beach Club’s pool and sun loungers for cocktail time. Unlike Palawan Beach, there are safety Beach patrollers only on weekends and public holidays.

Coney Island: Rugged Singapore beach Image credit: NParks Coney Island is a rugged Singapore beach surrounded by a vast green forest. It’s nothing like the expansive sandy Singapore beaches of Palawan or Siloso, but a trip here does make a fun seaside day out. Rather than coming here just for beach time, explore this stunningly green forested island on foot or bike along the 2.5 km Coney Island Park Connector. The beach is a hit with birdwatchers, so don’t be surprised if you spot one of 80 species of birds on Coney Island Park, including the resident male Baya Weavers, Oriental Magpies, or flocks of parakeets. Beachside dining: No F&B here — best to pack a picnic! Coney Island , Punggol Promenade Nature Walk, Singapore 829325, www.nparks.gov.sg 5.

Changi Beach Park: Singapore beach for plane spotting Plane spotters head over to Changi Beach Singapore – one of the most scenic and best beaches in Singapore – to watch low-flying planes preparing to land at Changi Airport. If you are into sandcastles and splashing around in the sea, you can enjoy that here, too, along the 3.3km long Singapore beach of Changi Beach Park. One of the best Singapore beaches, Changi Beach stretches from Changi Point to Changi Ferry Terminal and overlooks Pulau Ubin. There’s also cycling, fishing, and BBQ pits, so this is one of the best Singapore beaches for social fun.

The best Singapore beach here is actually on Lazarus Island ( see below ) but St John’s Island is worth exploring too. Rather than beach life, St John’s offers a chance to explore flora and fauna. The lagoons to the right of the jetty are rich in starfish, crabs, and other marine life like horseshoe crabs and tropical fish. There is no F&B so bring your picnic and water and have a fun picnic by the ocean!

You’ll need to get a boat from Marina South Pier to St John’s first, then it’s about a 20-minute walk on a cement path (stroller-friendly) to Lazarus. Want a direct drop at this Singapore beach? Take a ferry from Sentosa Cove or hire your own boat ! Lazarus Island offers a soft sandy Singapore beach with shallow waters. If you want to pretend you are on holiday, this is the best Singapore beach for that! Go mid-week and it can be lovely and quiet, but this Singapore beach gets busy on weekends. There’s not much shade so bring hats and sunscreen . As with St John’s Island, pack your own picnic and enjoy your meal by the sea.

Punggol Beach: Near Punggol Waterway Park Image credit: hjbyeo via Flickr A Singapore beach peppered with small boulders awaits at Punggol Beach in Northern Singapore making this a great spot for arty photo shots. Punggol Beach Singapore, which is close to Punggol Waterway Park has a rather dark history: this is the site of the Sook Ching Massacre in 1942, and there is an on-site heritage marker for those who want to read up on this tragic event.

Nearby dining: Georges @ The Cove Pasir Ris Park, Pasir Ris Central, Opposite Pasir Ris MRT Station, Singapore 519639, www.nparks.gov.sg 13. Kusu Island: Singapore Beach with Temples Kusu Island is home to a famous tortoise sanctuary, so this spot is popular with fans of this sacred animal and for those wishing to visit the temples here. The Singapore beach here is small and quaint so if you are looking for a vast Singapore beach it might be better to stick to Lazarus Island. To get there, just ride one extra stop on the St. John’s Island ferry that departs from Marina South Pier. Nearby Dining: None Kusu Island, 31 Marina Coastal Dr, Singapore 018988 14. Sisters’ Islands Marine Park: Singapore beach with snorkelling Image credit: NParks At Sisters’ Islands Marine Park you can swim at high tide and there are snorkelling opportunities to explore the rich biodiversity of the Marine Park.

To get there, can book a boat from Marina South Pier. Nearby Dining: None. Bring your own picnic (but look out as monkeys might steal your food) Sisters’ Islands Marine Park , 60 West Coast Ferry Road, Singapore 126979 Safety swim tips for Singapore beaches: Not all Singapore beaches are patrolled by lifeguards, so swim at your own risk and never leave children unattended. Always be wary of strong undercurrents. Where Singapore beaches are monitored, a red flag indicates that it is dangerous to swim, possibly due to lightning warnings, strong currents, jellyfish or other hazards (oil spill, poor visibility, flotsam).

If it’s too hot or too rainy for an outdoor park or playground , then why not consider bowling in Singapore with the kids instead? Older kids will love the independence of having their own bowling lane, but it’s also a fun kids’ activity for little ones as young as age 3, thanks to these bowling alleys in Singapore with side bumpers for kids, ramps, as well as children’s bowling shoes! Here’s our guide to the best alleys for bowling in Singapore with kids, including bowling prices, bowling alleys near you, and any special family-friendly info. Tips for bowling in Singapore with kids: But before you pack the kids and head down for a spot of bowling, consider these tips first: Book ahead to reserve a bowling lane with side bumpers for very small kids. If the bowling alley doesn’t have shoes small enough for your child to rent (usually around $1.50/pair) they will allow kids to wear their own shoes – just make sure these are covered like trainers (no flip flops, open-toed sandals or Crocs). You must wear socks when renting bowling shoes. Many places offering bowling in Singapore have party venue packages for those looking to celebrate birthdays without the mess at home! If you’re already well-versed in all things bowling, then check out these awesome kid-friendly places to go bowling in Singapore!

Read our comprehensive guide on how to play pickleball, where to play pickleball in Singapore, pickleball courts in Singapore and why everyone’s talking about it. It’s a bit like badminton, but without the constant smashes, and a bit like tennis , but without the heavy racket. Enter pickleball – the sport that’s now Singapore’s favourite! If you’ve spotted players at neighbourhood pickleball courts or community centres, you’re not alone in feeling the pickleball FOMO. And yes, it’s kid-friendly, too! We uncover all you need to know to jump into the game: the basics of pickleball rules, the top spots to play pickleball in Singapore, and where to find everything you need – from pickleball paddles and balls to the perfect pickleball net. Jump to: – What is pickleball ? – How to play pickleball – Where to play pickleball in Singapore – Where to buy pickleball paddles, balls and net Read more: Ultimate Guide to Adventure Sports for Kids in Singapore What is pickleball? Image credit: Decathlon Simply put, pickleball is a unique blend of badminton, table tennis, and tennis, combining the best of each sport, which is why it’s easily gaining traction in Singapore. Played in singles or doubles, it uses solid-faced paddles and a lightweight perforated plastic ball. No need to feel intimidated—pickleball is perfect for all ages! Played on a badminton-sized court with a low net (like tennis) and a lightweight, perforated ball, this sport offers a slower ball speed, making pickleball an ideal sport for beginners and younger players. Kids, especially, can develop their coordination and confidence without feeling overwhelmed. Read more: Best Swim Schools & Swimming Lessons for Kids, Toddlers & Adults Rules of pickleball: How to play pickleball Pickleball Singapore rules: Image credit: PickleGo We’ve been saying this quite a bit, but pickleball doesn’t have to be intimidating and it is really easy to pick up, making it a great sport for all ages. Here are some terms that you should know before you start playing: 1. Court and equipment: One of the great things about pickleball is that you don’t need a dedicated court to play! You can set up on a rectangular court (like a badminton court) with a low net. Grab some pickleball paddles and a perforated plastic ball, and you’re ready to go! 2. Serving: Start playing pickleball by serving underhand from the right side of the court, aiming diagonally to the opponent’s service box, which is the area where the ball needs to land. Just make sure the ball clears the non-volley zone (or kitchen) and lands in the opposite court! 3. Volleying: In pickleball, volleying refers to the action of hitting the ball before it bounces on the court. It has to occur while the ball is in the air, after it has crossed the net. 4. Non-Volley Zone (Kitchen): The area near the net is called the kitchen. When volleying, players need to stay out of this zone. Note that the terms “non-volley zone” and “kitchen” refer to the same area and are often used interchangeably in pickleball! 5. Double Bounce Rule: After the first serve, the ball must bounce once on each side before anyone can start volleying. 6. Scoring: In pickleball, only the serving team can score points. Games are usually played to 11, 15, or 21 points, and you must win by at least two points to claim victory. 7. Rotating Servers: Remember when we said only the serving team scores? Here’s the fun part: Every time the serving team scores a point, they rotate service. In doubles, both players on a team get a turn to serve before switching sides. 8. Faults: A fault happens when the ball goes out of bounds, into the net, or when a player volleys from the non-volley zone. Read more: Best Football Academies & Football Clubs In Singapore For Kids How to play pickleball: Now that you have the rules of pickleball at the back of your hand, here are some basics on the gameplay to get you started: 1. Grab your play buddies: You can choose to play pickleball in singles or doubles, so assemble your team! 2. Gather your gear: Grab a pickleball paddle, and a perforated ball, and find a pickleball court. It can also be a badminton court where you can fix your own pickleball net! 3. Start to serve: Get the game going by standing behind the baseline and serving underhand diagonally to your opponent’s service box. Just make sure the ball clears the non-volley zone (the kitchen) for a legal serve! 4. Get the ball rolling (or bouncing): Ensure the ball bounces once on each side before anyone starts volleying. This rule is called the double bounce rule! 5. Stay in your lane: When volleying, remember to stay out of the non-volley zone to avoid faults. You can enter the kitchen to fetch the ball, but be careful not to volley while you’re inside it. 6. Keeping score: In pickleball, only the serving team can score points, so when the serving team begins to serve, a rally starts. If any faults occur during the rally, it means the serving team does not score a point, and the serve rotates to the opposing team. They will then start a new rally by serving and can score points during their turn. Keep playing until one team reaches the point limit – usually 11, 15, or 21 – and wins by at least two points.

Neighbourhood Badminton Courts: FREE pickleball courts in Singapore Image credit: Our Neighbourhood You can play pickleball for free at any neighbourhood badminton courts across the island – just set up your pickleball net, and you’re ready to play! Since these pickleball courts are free to use, they can get quite busy, so it’s best to play during non-peak hours. We recommend going on weekday mornings or after 8pm to increase your chances of securing a court. 2. Community Clubs & Sports Halls: Pickleball courts in Singapore Image credit: OnePA Singaporeans and Permanent Residents can easily book a pickleball court at local community centres or sports halls (usually located in schools) to play pickleball.

Where to buy pickleball equipment: Paddle, balls and nets Image credit: Unsplash Pickleball equipment can vary widely in price and cater to players of all skill levels. For beginners, there’s no need to break the bank on a high-end pickleball paddle. You can find affordable options that still provide great quality and performance. Along the way, as you develop your skills and gain more experience, you can consider upgrading to a better pickleball paddle, such as one that offers better grip, and improved durability.

      "content": "Kidfluencing – where likes, views, and brand deals become the new normal. We break down what kidfluencing and kidfluencers are, why it matters, and what parents need to watch out for. Ever stumbled upon the Instagram of a 2-year-old? Or catch a TikTok of 4-year-olds being all cute and silly, racking up tens of thousands of likes and views? And let’s not even get started on YouTube, where kid influencers are taking over with toy unboxings, skits, vlogs, and all kinds of crazy challenges. Child influencers, or kidfluencers, are blowing up, and in the past two decades, they’ve become a major force in online marketing–and now there’s a Netflix documentary about it. But what happens when those innocent videos turn into something much bigger? Are these kids simply having fun, or is there something more behind the screens? And as parents, we have to ask ourselves: How much is too much when it comes to putting our kids in front of the camera online? What is kidfluencing? Image credit: Ryan’s World via Instagram (Ryan Kaji) The world of kidfluencing is a complex one that’s filled with highly stimulating content, colourful clickbait-y thumbnails, and where likes, views, and brand deals fuel the success of these personalities. In fact, some kidfluencers can rake in upwards of $30,000 a month! For example, Ryan Kaji (one of the pioneer kidfluencers and possibly the highest-paid to date), part of Ryan’s World (formerly Ryan ToysReview) garnered over 38.5 million subscribers and more than 59.4 billion views through videos of him reviewing toys. There are even sources that say he earned $29.5 million in 2020 alone! Kidfluencers can also be part of family vlogging channels, which have grown in popularity over the past few years. These videos can be found across multiple platforms, with viewers tuning in to watch kids grow up. Engagement often comes in the form of likes, shares and video saves. And in some cases, fans even send gifts. Is it exploitative? Is it safe? Image credit: Pinterest (Piper Rockelle and The Squad) At first, the huge earnings and popularity from seemingly harmless videos might seem innocent, and maybe even a little exciting. But as kidfluencers rise in popularity, so do concerns about exploitation, online safety and ethics. Over the years, some parent influencers have been exposed for abuse and even jailed, with heartbreaking cases of kids being forced to create inappropriate content for the cameras. The Netflix show ‘Bad Influence: The Dark Side of Kidfluencing’ focuses on 11-year-old Piper Rockelle, a popular YouTuber. The documentary reveals the dark truth behind her popularity, where her mother orchestrated inappropriate content, forcing Piper and her friends to film. It also exposes a fan, pretending to be a girl, who was actually an older male, creating accounts with Piper’s photos and leaving inappropriate comments. But where do we draw the line? How can we tell the difference between a parent simply sharing their joy and a parent who’s really crossing the line into exploiting their child? The tricky part is, the line isn’t always clear, and most of the time, these kids pay the price. Constant filming, pressure to perform, and growing up in the public eye can all take a toll, and kidfluencing can have a bigger impact on kids than we think. The impact of kidfluencing on kids Image credit: Sabine Vilumsone (Gaby & Alex) Being a kidfluencer isn’t all bad. Some kids genuinely enjoy creating content, and it can build confidence, and creativity, and even be a fun family bonding activity. But once views and income come into play, the lines between play and work can get blurry. Some children feel pressure to perform, stay “on brand,” or keep churning out content just to stay relevant. That kind of pressure can affect their self-worth and lead to anxiety. And let’s not forget that hateful comments exist and in this case, they target actual kids, often with zero empathy. In a world where likes equal validation, those words can hurt deeply. While the child might be the face, it’s usually the parents behind the camera. And without proper regulations (unlike the rules protecting child actors), there’s little to stop potential overwork or even exploitation. Netflix’s Bad Influence: The Dark Side of Kidfluencing revealed just how bad it can get: 12-hour workdays, verbal abuse, and even sexual abuse. When parents become managers, it’s easy for the line to blur between doing what’s best for your child and doing what’s best for the algorithm. What parents can do So how do we protect our kids? Start by making sure they know content creation isn’t everything. Talk to them about what they see online, help them separate fact from fiction, and remind them that likes and follows don’t define their worth. Be mindful about privacy. Avoid sharing overly personal photos or information. With deepfakes and AI-generated content on the rise, think twice before posting. And yes, it’s worth doing the occasional follower list audit to flag any shady accounts. Most importantly, be sure to check in on their mental health! Kidfluencing isn’t going away anytime soon. But with awareness and boundaries, we can make sure our kids are protected, respected, and reminded that they are loved for who they are and not for what they post. If you know someone in need of support, here are some useful hotlines and resources that can help.

If you are looking for honest reviews on family-friendly condos in Singapore, you’ve come to the right place. Condo rentals are at a real high right now , and if you are looking to move condo, you’ll want to know which one would suit your family best. Need (or want rather) a big pool for little ones to take up swimming lessons or tennis courts for a sporty activity with your husband, a buzzing social scene or quiet chilled vibes? We’ve spoken with mamas across the island to put together these Singapore condo reviews for places in Sentosa, East Coast, Orchard, River Valley, Holland Village and more. Click through our gallery (condos listed by district) to get the pros, the cons, and the nitty-gritty on amenities and transport links. You may not be surprised to find out that just about everyone rates their condo for family-friendliness! Other factors to consider when choosing a condo in Singapore: New vs. Old: With the former, you’re more likely to get fabulous facilities (water slide, karaoke room or golf simulator, anyone?) and high-end appliances. Older condos – particularly those built in the 90s or earlier – offer A LOT more internal space and tend to be lower density, with more green space. Big vs. Small: Unsurprisingly, the bigger condos (400+ units) tend to have on-site conveniences like mini-marts (or even doctor’s offices or preschools), in addition to multiple pools, tennis courts, bigger gyms, etc. Smaller condos provide a more intimate feel, which can be a nice change of pace in a bustling city like Singapore.

Plan a day out at Changi Bay Point, where you can take a stroll along the boardwalk with the kids, cycle by the sea and get a break from city life Changi Bay Point offers Jeju-like views without leaving our little red dot! This hidden gem on the East Coast boasts amazing Insta-worthy views that make you feel like you’re in South Korea! Because it’s tucked away, you get to escape the typical crowd, soak in the sea breeze and truly enjoy a breath of fresh air. Whether it’s cycling along the Changi Bay Park Connector with the kids or strolling along the Changi East Boardwalk for sunset views , Changi Bay Point is a spot you must add to your bucket list. Here’s our kid-friendly guide to Changi Bay Point so you can plan your next family day out! Jumplinks: – Things to Do at Changi Bay Point – Where to Eat at Changi Bay Point – How to Get to Changi Bay Point – Round Island Route: Changi Bay Point Park Connector Map Things to do at Changi Bay Point: 1. Take in the Jeju Island in Singapore Vibes Image credit: @avchiang via Urban Redevelopment Authority via Facebook Most of us can’t pack our bags and take a vacation whenever we want. That’s why we’re thankful for places like Changi Bay Point, which gives us a break from the hustle and bustle of the city with breathtaking views. Unlike Sentosa where you’ll see plenty of ships along the coastline, you’ll find it hard to spot a ship in the ocean at Changi Bay Point. If you’re an early bird, you’ll be able to catch the sunrise and a cool breeze that mimics scenes from a K-drama that was shot at Jeju Island. 2. Take Insta-worthy photos of the Lone Tree at Changi Bay Point Image Credit: cattan2011 via Flickr The lone trees at Upper Seletar Reservoir and Jurong Lake Gardens are well known by keen photographers, but Changi Bay Point boasts a “floating” tree. During high tide, this lone tree appears to be floating in the sea with its roots planted on the shoreline. There are lots of photo opportunities around Changi Bay Point (s= sunrise and sunset are usually the best times for pics) so take out your phones or cameras and snap plenty of photos for the gram. It’s a fun thing to do with kids too (and distracts them from complaining about “boring” walks!) 3. Changi Bay Park Connector: Cycling at Changi Bay Point Image credit: SGBike If there’s one thing that’s true about Singaporeans, it’s that many of us love cycling , and we’re so blessed to have smooth cycling paths that allow us to journey from one end of the island to another. Changi Bay Park Connector is a 3.5km cycling path that takes you along the eastern corridor of the Round-Island-Route, which spans a total of 75km, certainly not for the faint of heart! Enjoy a scenic view of sand and sea that will hopefully take your mind off the burning sensation in your legs. 4. Stroll at Changi East Boardwalk at Changi Bay Point Image credit: cattan2011 via Flickr Enjoy a leisurely walk along the Changi East Boardwalk that takes you even closer to the water’s edge. There’s a small pavilion with benches so you can give your legs a rest and take in the tranquil view. 5.

      "content": "Struggling with itchy and irritated eczema-prone skin? Try these simple tips and over-the-counter eczema creams, anti-itch creams, soaps and skincare products to soothe, rebuild and repair your child’s skin Looking for eczema creams in Singapore to help your little one’s eczema or atopic dermatitis? Often, these patches of inflamed, itchy skin can appear red, cracked or rough, and may even have blisters. If you suspect your child has eczema, it’s always best to consult your doctor. If your child’s eczema does not respond to over-the-counter eczema creams, if their condition worsens or if the skin has become infected, they may need a stronger prescription-only eczema product or steroid cream. Help alleviate eczema symptoms with these tips: Bathe your child in soothing lukewarm water. Use a mild soap or a non-soap cleanser when washing. After a bath gently pat skin dry with a towel (don’t rub the skin which can irritate it and tear the skin). Follow the golden 3-minute rule: “lock in” moisture by applying moisturiser within 3 minutes of bathing. Moisturise daily with a good skin-barrier-healing moisturiser. Choose your child’s clothing wisely: avoid rough, synthetic and scratchy fibres in favour of cotton and soft fabrics. Keep your little one’s fingernails short to prevent their nails from breaking the skin if they scratch too hard. Keep a diary of what your child’s eczema triggers and skin irritants might be; these can range from harsh soaps, detergents, shampoos, and disinfectants, to things in their diet like dairy products, eggs, soy and wheat, or allergens like pets and pollen. What causes eczema? Unfortunately, the causes of eczema still remain unknown, and there are no cures or treatment options for eczema. However, what can help are eczema creams and anti-itch products that are designed to control and minimise inflammation, while moisturising skin and building its natural protective barrier. We’ve sorted out some of the best eczema creams in Singapore, which aim to soothe and minimise symptoms of atopic dermatitis or eczema in order to heal the affected skin and prevent flare-ups of itchiness and other eczema symptoms. Do note that some over-the-counter eczema creams contain steroids such as hydrocortisone. Always check with a doctor or paediatrician before applying these eczema creams on a baby’s skin.

Marina South Pier: Quiet fireworks viewing spot Image credit: Paul Ang via Flickr Located along Marina Coastal Drive, Marina South Pier is tucked further away from the prime location for the 2025 NDP fireworks, but you’ll probably still be able to see the fireworks. If you have younger kids who might be afraid of very loud noises, then this might be a great place to catch the National Day fireworks without busting your eardrums! Where: 31 Marina Coastal Drive, Singapore 018988 Access via: Marina South Pier MRT, Exit B 12. Marina Square Rooftop: View of Marina Bay fireworks Image credit: DPGreen Okay, you might not get the best views from this spot. But since it overlooks part of the Singapore cityscape, including Marina Bay Sands, you should be able to catch a glimpse of the National Day Parade fireworks. Since it’s located on the rooftop of a popular mall downtown, it might get crowded. So, be sure to get there early to save the best spot to see the NDP fireworks! Where: Rooftop of Marina Square, 6 Raffles Blvd, Singapore 039594 Access via: top floor of the Marina Square Mall, 4-min walk from Esplanade MRT station via Exit C 13. Singapore Flyer: Prime fireworks viewing spot Image credit: Singapore Flyer via Facebook Catching the NDP 2025 fireworks in Singapore from the Singapore Flyer will give you the best bird’s eye view, and because it’s the hottest seat in the nation, the tickets get sold out quickly! It’s a bit of a cheat entry into the best ‘free’ spots to watch the 2025 NDP fireworks since you still have to buy a ticket to the flyer. Where: 30 Raffles Avenue, Singapore 039803 Access via : Promenade MRT Station National Day Parade 2025 fireworks in Singapore’s heartlands Image credit: Ministry of Defence, Singapore (MINDEF) via Facebook National Day SG60 celebrations will take place across the island, includingthe heartlands, so you’re guaranteed to be able to view the stunning 2025 National Day fireworks near you.

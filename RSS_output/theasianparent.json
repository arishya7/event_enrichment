      "content": "Every culture has its time-honored remedies for nurturing a healthy pregnancy, and few are as celebrated or as aromatic as saffron milk. While modern medicine plays a crucial role in prenatal care, ancient remedies still hold value for many expecting mothers. Among them, saffron milk , a golden-hued, aromatic drink steeped in tradition. But how safe is it during pregnancy? Can a few strands of this luxurious spice truly benefit you and your baby? This article blends time-honored wisdom with scientific research to uncover the truth about saffron milk during pregnancy. What Is Saffron Milk? Saffron milk, often called kesar doodh , is a warm beverage made by infusing milk with a few strands of saffron. It may include other ingredients like cardamom, almonds, or turmeric, depending on cultural or personal preferences. Saffron, derived from the Crocus sativus flower, is the world’s most expensive spice by weight, prized for its distinctive aroma, vibrant color, and therapeutic properties. Traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine , saffron milk is believed to boost immunity, improve complexion, and uplift mood. But during pregnancy, its benefits and risks warrant closer examination. Is Saffron Milk Safe During Pregnancy? Saffron Milk During Pregnancy: Benefits, Safety, and Best Practices Yes, saffron milk can be safe during pregnancy when consumed in moderation. The key is dosage. While saffron offers several potential health benefits, excessive intake may lead to uterine contractions, especially in the first trimester. Most healthcare professionals and nutritionists recommend limiting saffron consumption to 2 to 3 strands per day steeped in milk, particularly after the first trimester. The spice is potent, and more is not always better. As always, it’s essential to consult your OB-GYN before adding any herbal or traditional remedies to your prenatal routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions. Nutritional Benefits of Saffron Milk Rich in Antioxidants Saffron contains powerful antioxidants like crocin, safranal, and kaempferol. These compounds help neutralize free radicals in the body, which can reduce inflammation and boost overall immunity. Promotes Healthy Digestion Digestive discomfort, including bloating and constipation, is common during pregnancy. Saffron has carminative properties that may soothe the digestive tract and improve metabolism when consumed in small quantities. Supports Emotional Well-being and Reduces Stress Hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy can affect mood. Saffron is known for its mild antidepressant effects and can help improve mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety and stress. Clinical studies suggest saffron supplementation may even help with mild to moderate depression. May Help with Blood Pressure Regulation Some studies suggest saffron may support cardiovascular health by helping to regulate blood pressure and improve circulation. This is particularly helpful during pregnancy when blood volume increases and maintaining healthy blood pressure becomes crucial. Cultural Beliefs Around Saffron in Pregnancy In many Indian, Persian, and Middle Eastern cultures, saffron milk is traditionally believed to promote a fair complexion in babies, a belief not supported by science. However, its use in pregnancy is culturally linked to enhancing vitality, calming the mind, and nurturing the mother. While these beliefs persist, modern healthcare professionals emphasize its nutritional rather than cosmetic value. Potential Risks of Saffron Milk During Pregnancy Overconsumption and Uterine Contractions Saffron in high doses (more than 5 grams) is considered unsafe and may stimulate uterine contractions, potentially leading to preterm labor or miscarriage. Always stick to small quantities, just 2 to 3 strands per serving. Allergic Reactions Though rare, saffron can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals, including dry mouth, dizziness, or nausea. Discontinue use and consult your doctor if any symptoms appear. Impact on Blood Pressure for Sensitive Individuals While saffron can help stabilize blood pressure, in some cases, it may cause slight drops. If you are prone to low blood pressure, discuss this with your healthcare provider before use. Best Time to Drink Saffron Milk During Pregnancy Saffron Milk During Pregnancy: Benefits, Safety, and Best Practices Evening is often ideal, as saffron’s calming properties may help with better sleep. It can be introduced safely during the second trimester and continued in moderation through the third. FAQs 1. Can saffron milk help with pregnancy mood swings? Yes, saffron has natural mood-lifting properties and may help reduce anxiety and emotional stress during pregnancy. 2. Is it safe to drink saffron milk daily during pregnancy? Yes, but only in small amounts—2–3 strands of saffron per day is the safe recommended limit. 3. When should I start drinking saffron milk while pregnant? It’s best to start in the second trimester after consulting with your OB-GYN. 4. Does saffron milk affect baby’s complexion? No, there is no scientific evidence that saffron influences skin color. Its benefits are nutritional and emotional. 5. How many saffron strands are safe to use during pregnancy? Stick to 2–3 strands per day steeped in milk. Avoid excess to prevent adverse effects. A Golden Elixir in Moderation Saffron milk during pregnancy can be a warm, soothing, and nutritious addition to your diet provided it’s consumed responsibly. Rich in antioxidants, known for calming the nerves, and steeped in tradition, this luxurious spice offers more than just flavor. Keep the dosage low, choose high-quality saffron, and always seek medical advice if unsure. As with many things in pregnancy, balance is everything.",

      "content": "When you’re expecting, every bite and sip you take matters. From morning sickness to late-night cravings, pregnancy comes with its own set of nutritional puzzles. Among the growing range of plant-based alternatives, oat milk has quickly risen as a favorite. But is oat milk good for pregnancy? If you’re curious about whether this creamy, dairy-free drink belongs in your prenatal diet, you’re not alone. Let’s explore how oat milk stacks up nutritionally, what benefits it offers for mom and baby, and what experts have to say. Nutritional Benefits of Oat Milk During Pregnancy Is Oat Milk Good for Pregnancy? Nutritional Benefits & Expert Advice Oat milk brings a lot to the table especially for moms-to-be looking for a gentle, lactose-free milk option. 1. High in Fiber for Digestive Support Pregnancy often slows digestion, leading to bloating and constipation. Oat milk, rich in soluble fiber like beta-glucan, promotes regular bowel movements and a healthy gut. 2. Fortified with Essential Nutrients Most commercial oat milk brands are fortified with: Calcium and Vitamin D : For fetal bone development Vitamin B12 : Supports neurological health Folic Acid : Reduces risk of neural tube defects 3. Heart-Healthy and Low in Saturated Fat Oat milk contains heart-supporting compounds like beta-glucans and is naturally low in saturated fats and cholesterol, making it a heart-smart choice during pregnancy. 4. Gentle on the Stomach and Allergen-Friendly Oat milk is lactose-free, making it suitable for women with dairy intolerance. It’s also a safe option for those with soy or nut allergies, provided it’s certified gluten-free if needed. Potential Drawbacks and Considerations Despite its many benefits, oat milk isn’t perfect. 1. Lower in Protein Compared to dairy or soy milk, oat milk has less protein. Ensure you’re supplementing with other protein-rich foods like legumes, eggs, or lean meats. 2. Watch for Added Sugars Some flavored oat milks contain high levels of added sugar. Opt for unsweetened, fortified versions to keep your sugar intake in check. 3. Gluten Cross-Contamination Though oats are naturally gluten-free, contamination can occur. If you’re gluten-sensitive, make sure to choose certified gluten-free oat milk. Expert Recommendations Is Oat Milk Good for Pregnancy? Nutritional Benefits & Expert Advice Registered dietitians and obstetricians generally agree that oat milk is safe and beneficial during pregnancy when consumed in moderation. One to two servings per day can comfortably fit into a well-rounded prenatal diet, especially when using fortified brands. FAQs 1. Can I drink oat milk every day while pregnant? Yes, up to 1–2 servings daily of fortified, unsweetened oat milk is generally considered safe and beneficial. 2. Is oat milk safe in the first trimester? Yes, its gentle nature and folic acid content support early fetal development and digestion. 3. Does oat milk have enough calcium for pregnancy? Fortified oat milk typically contains similar calcium levels to cow’s milk. Always check the label. 4. Is oat milk good for gestational diabetes? Unsweetened oat milk may be suitable due to its fiber content, but always consult your doctor. 5. Can oat milk cause bloating during pregnancy? It’s generally easy to digest, but those sensitive to fiber or gluten should choose carefully. A Comforting Choice With Nutritional Merit So, is oat milk good for pregnancy? 100% YES, when chosen wisely. Its fiber content, fortification with essential nutrients, and smooth, comforting texture make it a wonderful addition to many prenatal diets. Just be mindful of added sugars and pair it with protein-rich foods to round out your nutrition. As always, consult your healthcare provider to tailor your choices to your unique needs. With a little care, oat milk can be more than just a dairy alternative. It can be a nourishing companion on your journey to motherhood.",

If you have a soy allergy or experience symptoms like bloating or hives, it’s best to avoid soy milk and consult your healthcare provider for safe alternatives. Choosing the Right Type of Soy Milk Fortified: Look for products enriched with calcium, vitamin D, and B12. Organic and Non-GMO: Reduces exposure to pesticides and genetically modified ingredients. Unsweetened: Minimizes added sugar intake, helping control weight and blood sugar levels. Expert Recommendations for Soy Milk Intake Health professionals including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and dietitians suggest that up to 1–2 servings of soy milk per day is safe and nutritious during pregnancy. It should be consumed as part of a varied and balanced prenatal diet. How to Incorporate Soy Milk Into Your Pregnancy Diet Is Soy Milk Good for Pregnancy?

Use in baking or cooking for creaminess without lactose. When to Avoid Soy Milk During Pregnancy Avoid soy milk if you have a diagnosed soy allergy or have been advised by your healthcare provider to limit phytoestrogen intake. Always choose reputable brands and check labels for added sugars and additives. FAQs 1. Can I drink soy milk every day during pregnancy? Yes, drinking 1–2 servings of soy milk daily is generally safe and beneficial for pregnant women, provided it’s part of a balanced diet. 2. Is soy milk safe during the first trimester? Yes, soy milk is safe in the first trimester and can support early fetal development due to its folic acid and protein content. 3. What are the alternatives to soy milk during pregnancy? Almond milk, oat milk, and fortified rice milk are great alternatives if you are allergic to soy or prefer a different taste. 4. Does soy milk increase estrogen levels in pregnancy? Soy contains phytoestrogens, but studies show that moderate consumption does not significantly affect estrogen levels in pregnant women. 5. Can soy milk cause miscarriage? There is no scientific evidence linking moderate soy milk consumption to miscarriage. Always consult with your doctor for peace of mind. Sip Smart, Stay Strong So, is soy milk good for pregnancy? Absolutely! When chosen wisely and consumed in moderation, it can be a valuable part of a nourishing prenatal diet. Packed with plant-based protein, essential nutrients, and free from lactose, soy milk serves as a supportive ally in your pregnancy journey.

      "content": "You never forget the moment your world shifts. For Benita, 43, that moment came quietly but decisively — not with a dramatic announcement, but during what was supposed to be a routine check-up at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. Her daughter Amelie, then just shy of three years old, had been admitted for a febrile seizure. But something else caught the doctor’s attention. When asked for her name, Amelie didn’t respond. She wasn’t engaging the way most children her age typically would. That small interaction sparked a journey that would forever change how Benita saw her daughter — and herself. After a referral to a Developmental and Behavioural Paediatrician, the confirmation came. Amelie was on the autism spectrum. As a parent, you might find yourself grappling with the same storm of emotions. Denial. Guilt. Sleepless nights filled with questions. Benita did. “I spent nights crying, questioning what had gone wrong — from my pregnancy to my parenting,” she recalls. “The diagnosis hit hard. There was guilt, fear, and deep uncertainty.” Living With Autism is Not Less — Just Different It’s okay to grieve the expectations you had. It’s okay to feel lost at first. But Benita wants you to know that a diagnosis of autism isn’t a life sentence. It’s a different roadmap. And it can be a gift. For her, receiving Amelie’s diagnosis brought not despair, but clarity. “It gave me permission to understand and accept her for who she truly is, rather than trying to fit her into neurotypical milestones,” she shares. That acceptance shifted everything. She stopped trying to correct behaviours like stimming or delayed responses. She began to build a parenting style that was structured yet loving, one that gave Amelie the predictability and clarity she needed to thrive. As a parent, you might feel like you’re drowning in unknowns. But as Benita’s story shows, the journey through autism can become one of empowerment, understanding, and even joy. “It took time to accept that Amelie was not “less,” but simply wired differently. “ When Support Systems Fall Short In Singapore, early intervention services do exist — but they’re often hard to access. After Amelie’s diagnosis, Benita was advised to enrol her in government-provided therapy. What she quickly discovered was how limited those sessions were. “Sometimes it was only once a quarter. It wasn’t enough,” she says. “We needed something more intensive.” So she did what many parents in her position do: she became a researcher, advocate, and warrior — all in one. Books, podcasts, online searches — she left no stone unturned. That’s how she found Bridging the Gap (BtG) in 2022. The multidisciplinary, integrated approach they offered was a breath of fresh air. For families looking for more than a piecemeal solution, BtG became a lifeline. Source: BtG The Cost of Care If you’re raising a child with autism, you know the financial strain is real. Therapy, assessments, specialist consultations — they all add up. For Benita’s family of six, surviving on one income, it wasn’t easy. “Budgeting for Amelie’s therapy was tough,” she says. But there was more than just the financial cost. There was the emotional one, too. “I had to educate myself from scratch on what autism really meant,” she shares. “There’s no manual. You’re constantly learning, adapting, and sometimes, failing.” But she kept going — driven by love, by hope, and by the strength of her support system. Her husband, she says, has been her greatest pillar. Together, they’ve learned to lean on each other. And with BtG offering consistent, evidence-based care, they began to feel less alone. Small Wins, Big Milestones Since starting at BtG, Amelie’s progress has been profound. She’s more focused, communicates more clearly, and is learning to navigate the world with increasing independence. “She can now balance on one foot, write with proper grip, and even wait safely to cross the road,” Benita shares proudly. These may seem like small milestones to others — but to a parent of a child with autism, they are everything. They are hard-won, deeply cherished, and proof that early, holistic intervention makes a difference. Autism and the Long Road to Emotional Endurance As the years have passed, Benita has grown into her role as a caregiver with wisdom, patience, and emotional resilience. But the toll is real. “It’s been a journey of joy, worry, exhaustion, and growth,” she admits. If you’re in the thick of it right now, know this: you’re not weak for feeling tired. You’re not failing for needing help. And you deserve a support system that holds you up when you can’t do it alone. For Benita, that includes her husband, her community, and centres like BtG that walk this road with families every step of the way. True Inclusion Starts With Us Autism is not just a condition to be managed — it’s a way of seeing the world. And that world, Benita argues, needs to do better. “True inclusion means recognising that every child — regardless of ability — deserves to be seen, supported, and accepted,” she says. Buzzwords won’t change hearts. Actions will. Inclusion means training educators, redesigning public spaces, and most importantly, teaching our own children that different is not deficient. If Amelie is to thrive in Singapore, we all need to make space for her — and others like her — to belong. This Autistic Pride Day, Let’s Walk With Families Like Benita’s Source: Adobe Stock As Autistic Pride Day approaches on June 18, take a moment to reflect not just on the triumphs of the Autistic community, but also on the journey families like Benita’s have walked. Autism isn’t something to fear — it’s something to understand. If you’re a parent navigating this journey, know that you are not alone. Support is out there. Community is out there. And your child — just like Amelie — is more than their diagnosis. They are capable of growing, thriving, and teaching you a whole new way of seeing the world. Take a breath. Ask for help. Tell your story. And most importantly — keep going. Need support? Reach out to ECDA-recognised centres like Bridging the Gap. Because your journey matters — and you don’t have to walk it alone.",

      "content": "Even though Singapore has one of the lowest maternal death rates in the world, cardiovascular disease is still one of the top causes of maternal deaths. With more women choosing to have kids later in life, it’s becoming even more important to look after heart health during pregnancy. Dr. Kua Jieli, an Interventional Cardiologist at Carrington Cardiology, shares expert tips on how to manage heart conditions during pregnancy and reduce long-term heart risks. How Pregnancy Affects the Heart During pregnancy, a woman’s body goes through a lot of changes to support the baby — especially the heart and blood vessels. According to Dr. Kua, “ Blood volume and the amount of blood the heart pumps go up by about 50%, while blood vessels relax and widen to help with flow, especially by the second trimester. The heart itself also changes; its size increases, and the main artery, the aorta, becomes more flexible. ” These changes are caused by pregnancy hormones like oestrogen, progesterone, and relaxin, which also help the placenta grow and make sure the baby gets enough blood and nutrients. For older mothers or women with pre-existing heart conditions, these changes can lead to complications like preeclampsia, stillbirth, early delivery, poor foetal growth, or heart problems during or after pregnancy, if not properly monitored. Pregnancy Complications That Signal Future Heart Risk Certain pregnancy complications serve as early indicators of heightened cardiovascular risk later in life. Dr. Kua identifies key conditions to watch for: Preeclampsia This is when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and often protein in her urine. It’s linked to a 2 to 4 times higher risk of getting high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or heart failure in the future. Gestational Hypertension Gestational hypertension means high blood pressure that starts during pregnancy, but without protein in the urine. It may go away after delivery, but it can be an early sign that the woman might develop long-term high blood pressure or heart disease later on. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes shows up during pregnancy but usually goes away afterwards. However, it raises the risk of getting type 2 diabetes, metabolic issues, and coronary artery disease down the road. Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) This is when the baby grows too slowly in the womb. It may point to issues with the mother’s blood flow or placenta, and could be a sign of deeper heart or blood vessel problems. Pre-Term Birth Giving birth too early can be linked to inflammation and blood vessel problems, which increase the mum’s long-term risk of heart disease. Stillbirth Women who experience stillbirth have a higher long-term risk of heart disease, including stroke and myocardial infarction. “These complications may act as a ‘stress test’ that reveals hidden problems with blood vessels or metabolism,” Dr. Kua emphasises. Recognising Early Signs of Cardiovascular Issues During Pregnancy Many early heart disease symptoms mirror typical pregnancy complaints and are often dismissed. Dr. Kua advises paying close attention to: Chest pain Fatigue Light-headedness Tachycardia rapid heart rate (>100 bpm) Shortness of breath , especially at rest Persistent cough Swelling in the limbs Frequent nighttime urination “Symptoms can appear during pregnancy or up to a year postpartum. If persistent, they may indicate a life-threatening cardiovascular condition,” he cautions. How Can Pregnant Women Manage Heart Disease? Managing heart conditions during pregnancy requires a combination of proactive planning, vigilant monitoring, and a team-based medical approach. According to Dr. Kua Jieli, “ Managing heart problems during pregnancy involves careful planning, close monitoring, and a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to ensure the safety of both mother and baby. ” For women with pre-existing cardiac conditions, preconception counselling is crucial. Risk assessments using tools such as the WHO maternal cardiovascular classification can guide treatment plans. Dr. Kua emphasises that medications like ACE inhibitors, statins, and warfarin should be substituted with pregnancy-safe alternatives before conception. Throughout pregnancy, routine tests such as echocardiograms and ECGs help monitor heart function. Physicians closely observe symptoms like palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling, which may signal deterioration. Safe medications may include beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics for fluid control, and aspirin for preeclampsia risk reduction. Dr. Kua notes, “ Delivery planning must be individualized, although vaginal delivery is typically preferred unless contraindicated by cardiovascular status. ” High-risk deliveries should occur in tertiary centres with cardiac support. Postpartum, the first six weeks are particularly critical, especially for patients with conditions like peripartum cardiomyopathy, necessitating continued monitoring. Why is Postpartum Cardiovascular Screening Essential? Despite the clear link between pregnancy complications and future cardiovascular disease (CVD), many postpartum programs omit heart health screening. Dr. Kua stresses that women with prior complications or existing heart disease must undergo routine assessments postpartum. “A multidisciplinary care approach—starting from delivery and extending up to a year postpartum—can identify risks early and improve long-term outcomes,” he adds. Common Myths About Pregnancy and Heart Health—Debunked Misinformation can put maternal health at risk. Dr. Kua addresses prevalent myths : “Pregnancy is a time to enjoy eating for two people.” While it’s true that pregnant women need more nutrition, it should never be to the point that they’re meeting the caloric needs for two people. Excessive weight gain can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. A balanced diet is key. Plan to gain only 2.3kg in the first half of pregnancy and 0.5kg per week thereafter . “Eating spicy foods while pregnant can cause birth defects or harm the baby.” There is no evidence to suggest spicy foods can harm a developing foetus. But it may worsen heartburn, which can already be a problem during pregnancy. “It is harmful to the baby when women sleep on their back.” There’s no need to panic if a pregnant woman ends up sleeping on her back — but there’s a bit of truth behind the concern. As the baby bump gets bigger, it can press down on a big vein called the inferior vena cava, which brings blood back to the heart. When this vein gets squashed, less blood flows back to the heart and around the body, including to the womb. This might make some women feel dizzy, sweaty, or even a bit nauseous. “Keeping a pregnant woman’s heart rate lower than 140 bpm.” This outdated advice is no longer supported. Regular exercise won’t increase the risk of miscarriage, early delivery, or having a low birth weight baby. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services actually recommends that pregnant women aim for about 150 minutes of moderate to intense exercise each week — and there’s no need to worry about sticking to a strict heart rate limit. However, it’s still important not to push yourself too hard. What Are Preventive Measures to Avoid Heart Issues in Pregnant Women? Preventive care is fundamental to reducing cardiovascular complications during pregnancy. A heart-healthy lifestyle—balanced nutrition, regular light-to-moderate exercise, and avoiding harmful substances like tobacco and alcohol—lays the groundwork for maternal well-being. In addition to lifestyle, managing existing risk factors is essential. Conditions such as hypertension and diabetes must be controlled before and during pregnancy to prevent complications. Routine prenatal care allows early detection of warning signs, such as elevated blood pressure, which may indicate conditions like preeclampsia. Education plays a pivotal role in prevention. Dr. Kua advises that women should seek immediate medical attention for “ chest pain, severe breathlessness (especially at rest), rapid weight gain, palpitations, or episodes of fainting, ” as these may indicate serious cardiovascular problems. By empowering women with knowledge and ensuring timely medical intervention, many pregnancy-related heart complications can be mitigated or avoided altogether. How Cardiologists and OB-GYNs Can Work Together “Cardiologists and OB-GYNs can enhance maternal care by fostering a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach that begins before conception and extends well into the postpartum period.” Starting with preconception counselling, It should include cardiovascular risk assessment, especially for those who are older, have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a history of heart problems During pregnancy, doctors from different specialities can come together to create a joint care plan for women with heart issues, whether pre-existing or newly diagnosed. Regular updates between the teams help make sure treatments are adjusted when needed. For high-risk pregnancies, a team that includes maternal-foetal medicine specialists, cardiologists, and anaesthesiologists can work together to ensure safer delivery. After giving birth, it’s still important to monitor heart health, as some conditions, like pregnancy-related heart conditions like peripartum cardiomyopathy or hypertension, can continue or even show up for the first time postpartum. Using shared health records, integrated care pathways, and joint clinics can help ensure mums get smooth, coordinated care at every stage. Improving Healthcare Systems for Better Postpartum Heart Health “ Healthcare systems can enhance cardiovascular follow-up for postpartum women by emphasising the importance of a multidisciplinary, team-based approach to postpartum cardiovascular care .” Dr. Kua said. This means cardiologists, OB-GYNs, maternal-foetal medicine specialists, and family doctors should all work closely together to make sure mums get smooth, continuous care from delivery to long-term heart management. To prevent women with pregnancy-related heart risks from falling through the cracks, hospitals and clinics should set up structured referral systems and personalised follow-up plans. This includes identifying women who are more likely to face heart disease later and helping them manage things like high blood pressure, weight, cholesterol, and stress — especially in the first year after giving birth. Healthcare professionals can also help by: Doing standard heart health checks before discharge and during follow-up visits. Using telehealth (video or phone consults) to make it easier for mums to attend appointments. Using digital tools, like health apps or reminders, to stay connected with new mums and keep them engaged in their care. All these steps can help make sure that mothers get the heart care they need — not just during pregnancy, but well after the baby is born.

      "content": "You’re probably familiar with Hair for Hope — the iconic annual campaign that sees brave souls across Singapore shaving their heads in solidarity with children battling cancer. But have you ever wondered what keeps some people coming back year after year? Meet Jason Ong. He’s a father of two, a consulting manager in the telecom industry, and one of Hair for Hope’s longest-running ambassadors. For 13 years, Jason has shaved, shared, rallied, and repeated — turning a single act of compassion into a lifelong mission to support families facing one of the toughest battles imaginable. As Singapore celebrates its 60th birthday, the Children’s Cancer Foundation is spotlighting powerful human-interest stories to kick off Hair for Hope 2025. And Jason’s journey is one worth hearing — not just for the legacy he’s built, but for the community he’s inspired along the way. The First Shave and the Unexpected Chain Reaction Jason first picked up the clippers back in 2008. What started as a simple act of support soon turned into something much bigger. Not only did he keep coming back to shave, but he also began organizing satellite events to grow the movement. “When I first shaved, my kids were still very young. I don’t think they really understood what was going on,” he recalls. But over time, the ritual became a teaching moment — a way to pass on values like empathy, resilience, and purpose. You know how it’s usually the organizers who chase people down? In Jason’s case, it was the opposite. His fellow “shavees” (yes, that’s a word) would beat him to the punch—emailing him months in advance to ask when the next satellite event was happening. That’s when he knew: this wasn’t just a one-off effort. It had become a community. “Each year when I shaved, I explained to them why I was doing it — to support children with cancer and their families.” Source: Hair for Hope 38 June School Holiday Activities & Events for Kids In 2010, when Jason organised his first Hair for Hope satellite event, he tried to get his son and daughter — then 10 and 8 years old — to join him on stage. “I kept pressing them to shave, but they kept refusing,” he laughs. Until one day, his son surprised him. “Just before the event, he told me he wanted to shave. I asked him why he changed his mind, and he said a classmate had cancer — he wanted to support him. I was really touched. It meant the message had sunk in.” That same day, Jason’s daughter joined her brother in solidarity. “Both of them shaved at the first satellite event. My son continued into his secondary school years, and my daughter shaved again when she was 12 and 16. They’ve stopped shaving for now — they’re quite attached to their hair — but they still help out at events, ushering and setting up. They’re still part of the movement.” Even as the kids grew older and stopped shaving their heads, they never stopped showing up. These days, they’re right there beside him at the events, helping with logistics—ushering guests, setting up stations, and quietly making things run smoothly behind the scenes. What Keeps Jason Coming Back? Motivation is a funny thing. You’d think after 13 years, the enthusiasm might fade. But for Jason, it’s only grown. When people around you believe in a cause so deeply that they nudge you about the next event, that’s something special. Source: Hair for Hope He’s seen the campaign evolve, watched his shavees return year after year, and built bonds with strangers who eventually became friends. That kind of community doesn’t just happen—it takes someone like Jason to make it stick. And if you’re wondering what it’s like to shave your head for the first time, Jason gets the hesitation. Will the hair grow back the same? Will I look weird bald? Valid concerns. But as he likes to say, it’s worth doing at least once—if not for the look, then for the lesson. More importantly, you’re showing children battling cancer that they’re not alone. Source: Hair for Hope Busting the Bald Myths Let’s address the elephant in the room. Yes, shaving your head is a bold move. And no, it’s not a “get out of shampoo free” card. “I know many people want to support, but they’re afraid,” he says. “Some worry their hair won’t grow back. Others worry they won’t look good bald.” His advice? Give it a try — just once. Source: Hair for Hope Jason laughs about how people often assume shaving means less effort. But in reality, scalp care is still a thing—especially in sunny Singapore. Even with a smooth head, you’ll need proper washing, sunscreen, and yes, shampoo. The key message? Don’t let vanity or myths hold you back from doing something good. Together, We Can… And Should This year’s theme for Hair for Hope is “Together, We Can” — and it perfectly sums up Jason’s journey. Through his efforts, Jason has not only supported children with cancer — he’s rallied a community, instilled lifelong values in his kids, and shown what it means to be an everyday hero. “For anyone going through cancer, or who has a loved one battling it — you are not alone,” Jason says. “Your family is there for you. But beyond that, there’s a big community of people, like us, who are here to support you. We may not know you personally, but we stand with you.” If Jason’s story moved you, maybe it’s time to take that leap yourself. Hair for Hope 2025 is more than just a campaign—it’s a national movement of solidarity, compassion, and courage. Don’t worry about the bald head. Worry about the kind of impact you want to leave behind. Because who knows? Maybe next year, it’ll be your story we’re sharing.",

        "Fetal Macrosomia"
      ],
      "content": "Imagine preparing for the arrival of your baby, only to discover that your little one is expected to be significantly larger than average. This scenario is a reality for many expectant parents facing fetal macrosomia. It is a condition where a newborn weighs more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams), regardless of gestational age. While a chubby baby might seem adorable, fetal macrosomia can lead to complications for both mother and child during delivery and beyond. Understanding the causes, risks, and management strategies is crucial for ensuring the health and safety of both. What Is Fetal Macrosomia? Fetal macrosomia refers to a condition where a baby is born with a weight exceeding 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams). In some definitions, a weight over 9 pounds, 15 ounces (4,500 grams) is considered macrosomic. This condition is distinct from “large for gestational age” (LGA), which considers the baby’s weight relative to the gestational age. Causes and Risk Factors Everything You Need to Know About Fetal Macrosomia Maternal Factors: Diabetes: Both pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes can lead to increased fetal growth due to higher glucose levels. Obesity: Excessive maternal weight before or during pregnancy can increase the risk. Excessive Weight Gain: Gaining more weight than recommended during pregnancy can contribute to fetal macrosomia. Previous Macrosomic Baby: Having delivered a large baby in the past increases the likelihood in subsequent pregnancies. Post-term Pregnancy: Pregnancies extending beyond 40 weeks can result in larger babies. Fetal Factors: Genetics: Family history can play a role in determining baby’s size. Male Sex: Male babies are statistically more likely to be larger at birth. Certain Medical Conditions: Conditions like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome can lead to increased fetal growth. Signs and Diagnosis Diagnosing fetal macrosomia before birth can be challenging. Healthcare providers may use the following methods: Ultrasound: Estimating fetal weight by measuring parts of the baby’s body. Fundal Height Measurement: Measuring the distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus. Physical Examination: Assessing the size and position of the baby through palpation. It’s important to note that these methods are not always accurate, and the true weight of the baby is often only known after birth. Potential Complications For the Mother: Prolonged Labor: A larger baby can lead to longer labor durations. Cesarean Delivery: Increased likelihood of requiring a C-section. Birth Canal Injuries: Higher risk of perineal tears and postpartum hemorrhage. For the Baby: Shoulder Dystocia: Difficulty delivering the baby’s shoulders after the head has emerged. Birth Injuries: Risk of fractures or nerve damage during delivery. Low Blood Sugar: Hypoglycemia shortly after birth. Childhood Obesity: Higher risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome later in life. Management and Treatment Options Everything You Need to Know About Fetal Macrosomia Prenatal Management: Monitoring: Regular ultrasounds to track fetal growth. Blood Sugar Control: Managing maternal glucose levels through diet, exercise, or medication. Weight Management: Ensuring appropriate weight gain during pregnancy. Delivery Planning: Mode of Delivery: Deciding between vaginal birth and cesarean delivery based on estimated fetal weight and maternal health. Timing: Considering early induction if the baby is growing rapidly. Postnatal Care: Monitoring Baby’s Health: Checking for hypoglycemia and other complications. Maternal Recovery: Addressing any birth injuries or complications experienced by the mother. Prevention Strategies Preconception Counseling: Managing chronic conditions like diabetes before pregnancy. Healthy Lifestyle: Maintaining a balanced diet and regular exercise during pregnancy. Regular Prenatal Visits: Monitoring fetal growth and maternal health consistently. Fetal macrosomia is a condition that requires careful monitoring and management to ensure the safety of both mother and child. By understanding the risk factors and working closely with healthcare providers, expectant parents can navigate this challenge effectively. Early detection, appropriate planning, and postnatal care are key components in managing fetal macrosomia and promoting healthy outcomes.",

      ],
      "content": "Childbirth should be a moment of joy, yet for thousands of women especially in low-resource settings, it becomes a source of lifelong suffering due to a preventable injury known as obstetric fistula. This condition not only leads to chronic physical discomfort and incontinence, but also strips women of their dignity, often resulting in social isolation, depression, and economic hardship. Despite being nearly eliminated in high-income countries, obstetric fistula remains a widespread issue in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, underscoring a profound global health disparity. This article explores the underlying causes, signs, treatment options, and global efforts aimed at eradicating this devastating condition once and for all. What is Obstetric Fistula? Obstetric fistula is an abnormal connection between a woman’s genital tract and her urinary tract or rectum, typically resulting from prolonged obstructed labor. The pressure from the baby’s head during extended labor can cut off blood flow to the surrounding tissues, causing them to die and creating a hole. This condition is most prevalent in regions with limited access to quality maternal healthcare. Types of Obstetric Fistula Vesicovaginal Fistula (VVF): An opening between the bladder and the vagina, leading to continuous urinary incontinence. Rectovaginal Fistula (RVF): An opening between the rectum and the vagina, resulting in fecal incontinence. Combined Fistula: Involves both urinary and fecal incontinence due to multiple openings. Causes and Risk Factors What You Need To Know About Obstetric Fistula Prolonged Obstructed Labor The primary cause of obstetric fistula is prolonged obstructed labor, where the baby cannot pass through the birth canal due to its size or the mother’s pelvic structure. Without timely medical intervention, such as a cesarean section, the sustained pressure can lead to tissue necrosis and fistula formation. Lack of Access to Quality Maternal Healthcare In many low-resource settings, women lack access to skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care. This deficiency increases the risk of complications during childbirth, including fistula development. Early Marriage and Teenage Pregnancy Young girls who marry and become pregnant before their bodies are fully developed are at higher risk of obstructed labor, leading to a greater likelihood of fistula. Malnutrition Poor nutrition can result in stunted growth and underdeveloped pelvises in women, making childbirth more difficult and increasing the risk of obstructed labor and fistula. Symptoms and Diagnosis Common Symptoms Continuous Leakage: Involuntary leakage of urine or feces through the vagina. Foul-Smelling Discharge: Persistent, unpleasant-smelling vaginal discharge. Recurrent Infections: Frequent urinary tract or vaginal infections. Skin Irritation: Irritation and sores in the genital area due to constant wetness. Social Isolation: Withdrawal from social interactions due to embarrassment and stigma. Diagnostic Procedures Physical Examination: A thorough pelvic exam to identify any abnormal openings. Dye Tests: Introducing a dye into the bladder to observe any leakage into the vagina, confirming a fistula. Imaging Tests: Utilizing imaging techniques like fistulograms to determine the fistula’s size and location. Treatment Option What You Need To Know About Obstetric Fistula Surgical Interventions Surgical repair is the primary treatment for obstetric fistula. The procedure involves closing the abnormal opening and restoring normal function. Success rates vary, with studies indicating closure rates ranging from 77.85% to 88.1%, depending on various factors, including the fistula’s complexity and the patient’s overall health. Post-operative care is crucial to ensure healing and prevent recurrence. Non-Surgical Support Counseling: Providing psychological support to help women cope with the trauma and stigma associated with fistula. Reintegration Programs: Assisting women in returning to their communities through education and vocational training. Physical Therapy: Rehabilitation exercises to strengthen pelvic muscles and improve continence. Prevention Strategies Improving Maternal Healthcare Ensuring access to quality maternal healthcare is vital. This includes: Skilled Birth Attendants: Training and deploying healthcare professionals to assist during childbirth. Emergency Obstetric Care: Establishing facilities equipped to handle childbirth complications. Antenatal Care: Regular check-ups during pregnancy to monitor the mother’s and baby’s health. Community Education Educating communities about the importance of maternal health can lead to: Delayed Marriages: Encouraging girls to marry and conceive at a mature age. Nutrition Awareness: Promoting proper nutrition for girls and women. Health-Seeking Behavior: Encouraging women to seek medical care during pregnancy and childbirth. Obstetric fistula remains a significant public health issue, particularly in low-resource settings. However, with concerted efforts focusing on prevention, timely treatment, and community support, it is a condition that can be eradicated. Empowering women through education, improving access to quality maternal healthcare, and supporting affected individuals are crucial steps toward a fistula-free world.",

      "content": "Over the past several months, Punggol residents have faced an unexpected challenge—monkey intrusions. With over 200 incidents reported within just seven months , the community is on high alert, especially parents concerned for their children’s safety. These encounters, often involving long-tailed macaques, are more than mere inconveniences—they’re disrupting routines, scaring kids, and exposing gaps in home safety. Why Are Monkeys Entering Residential Areas? Rapid urban development has pushed monkeys out of their habitats, while human activities like feeding or leaving food exposed encourage them to explore homes. With forested zones replaced by high-rise developments, monkeys have lost access to their usual food sources. The lure of open windows, food scraps, and even toys mimicking snacks drives them to explore human dwellings. Feeding monkeys, whether intentional or not, reinforces this behavior and escalates encounters. What Kind of Monkeys Are Involved? The long-tailed macaques are the species most commonly seen around Punggol and are known for their intelligence, curiosity, and adaptability. Long-tailed macaques are highly adaptive and intelligent primates. Their curiosity, combined with memory and social learning, makes them quick to identify accessible homes and revisit those with food rewards. These monkeys are not inherently aggressive but can become bold when accustomed to human presence. How to Monkey-Proof Your Home Simple, Effective Home Modifications Install grilles, locks, and netting on windows and balconies to block entry. Motion-sensor devices and visual deterrents can also help reduce visits. Install window grilles, child-safe latches, and mesh screens, especially on windows or balconies adjacent to green spaces. Motion-sensor alarms or deterrents like reflective tape or ultrasonic devices can reduce repeat visits from familiar monkeys. Daily Habits That Prevent Intrusions Secure food and baby items out of sight, and avoid actions that can unintentionally attract or reward monkey behavior. Keep all food out of sight—fruit bowls, leftovers, snacks, and even empty wrappers. Refrain from feeding monkeys, even accidentally. Avoid leaving baby bottles or lunch boxes near doors or windows. Store outdoor items like strollers or diaper bags indoors. Helping Children Cope with Monkey Encounters Emotional Impact on Kids Children may feel afraid after a monkey intrusion and need reassurance, validation, and open conversations to feel safe again. Children might develop fears of being alone or near balconies and windows. They may express these fears as nightmares, anxiety, or resistance to playing in familiar spaces. Open communication is essential—listen and acknowledge their fears without dismissing them. Teaching Safety Without Instilling Fear Turn the experience into a teachable moment by promoting respectful behavior and safety without causing unnecessary fear. Turn the incident into a learning opportunity. Teach kids about the importance of boundaries and respecting animals. Reinforce safe practices like not leaving food out and alerting adults if they see monkeys nearby. Extra Protection for Babies and Toddlers Safe Space Layout Tips Reorganize baby and toddler areas to avoid exposure near open windows, and ensure furnishings help keep little ones secure. If your child’s play or sleep area is near open windows, consider rearranging furniture to place cribs or playpens further away. Add high latches to reduce unsupervised access. Must-Have Safety Features Use netting, locks, and visual blockers to prevent monkey access and keep baby items hidden from view. Install mesh netting on windows, especially in nurseries. Ensure baby bottles, toys, and snack items are not visible from outside. This reduces the chance of monkeys being attracted to your child’s area. When to Call for Help Handling Aggressive or Persistent Monkeys Never attempt to confront or scare off monkeys yourself. Contact authorities for safe and legal removal. Do not confront or try to scare monkeys away yourself. Aggressive gestures may provoke them. Maintain a safe distance, and keep doors and windows closed until help arrives. Contact Numbers Save and use these emergency contacts to get quick help for monkey-related issues in Punggol. NParks 24-Hour Animal Response Centre : 📞 1800-476-1600 ACRES Wildlife Rescue Hotline : 📞 9783-7782 (7am–1am daily) FAQs Are monkey encounters in Punggol dangerous?

      ],
      "content": "As the global community continues to navigate the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging research highlights a growing concern: children recovering from COVID-19 may experience lingering gastrointestinal (GI) issues. Known as part of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), these symptoms can persist for months, impacting children’s quality of life and posing challenges for parents and caregivers. Understanding Post-COVID-19 Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Children Post-COVID-19 GI symptoms in children are becoming increasingly documented in clinical settings. Commonly reported issues include: Abdominal pain Diarrhea Nausea and vomiting Constipation Bloating Indigestion Recent studies show that children who have contracted COVID-19 are at a higher risk of developing such GI symptoms compared to those who have not been infected. While these symptoms can vary in severity, their persistence beyond the acute infection phase warrants medical attention and careful monitoring. Potential Mechanisms Behind Lingering GI Issues Post-COVID-19 Understanding why these symptoms persist involves exploring how the virus interacts with the body: ACE2 Receptors in the Gut: SARS-CoV-2 targets ACE2 receptors, which are abundantly present in the intestinal lining, , causing inflammation and discomfort. Disrupted good bacteria: COVID-19 may alter the gut microbiota, leading to imbalances that contribute to chronic GI symptoms and affect overall immune function. Leaky Gut Syndrome: The virus can compromise intestinal barrier integrity, allowing harmful substances to pass into the bloodstream, further fueling systemic inflammation and discomfort. GI Long-Term Implications and Risks Left unaddressed, lingering GI symptoms may evolve into more chronic conditions, including: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): long-term tummy pain Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Problems like acid reflux (heartburn) Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGIDs): Irritable bowel symptoms (frequent pain, constipation, or diarrhea) Moreover, children who experienced moderate to severe COVID-19 are at a heightened risk of prolonged GI distress. This highlights the necessity for ongoing health evaluations even after visible recovery. GI Management and Treatment Strategies Timely and proactive treatment can significantly improve outcomes: Early Medical Evaluation: Parents should not dismiss persistent GI complaints. A paediatrician can conduct necessary diagnostics and recommend appropriate therapies. Dietary Adjustments: A balanced, anti-inflammatory diet rich in fibre, fluids, and probiotics can help restore gut health. Supportive Therapies: Use of probiotics, antacids, or anti-diarrheal medications may be advised depending on specific symptoms. Behavioural support may also be needed to help children cope with chronic discomfort and its psychological impact. GI Preventive Measures and Recommendations Prevention remains the best strategy for protecting children’s long-term health: Vaccination: Ensuring children are vaccinated against COVID-19 significantly reduces the risk of both acute and long-term complications. Monitoring After Recovery: Regular follow-ups with healthcare providers can catch and treat emerging issues early. Parental Awareness: Parents should document and communicate any ongoing symptoms post-COVID-19 to their child’s doctor for timely intervention. Why Ongoing GI Monitoring Matters for Children After COVID-19 While most children recover fully from COVID-19, some experience a longer journey marked by gastrointestinal discomfort and disruption. These symptoms, though sometimes subtle, can evolve into more serious issues if not carefully managed. By remaining vigilant and proactive—through timely healthcare, nutritional support, and follow-up care—parents can play a critical role in ensuring their child’s recovery is complete, healthy, and resilient. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are the signs that my child may be experiencing post-COVID-19 GI issues? Persistent abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, constipation, and loss of appetite beyond the acute illness phase could signal lingering effects. 2. How long can GI symptoms persist in children after recovering from COVID-19? Symptoms may last several weeks to months. In some cases, they may become chronic if not addressed. 3. Are there specific treatments available for post-COVID-19 GI symptoms in children? Yes, treatments may include dietary adjustments, medications, and supportive therapies tailored to the child’s symptoms. 4. Can COVID-19 vaccination help prevent long-term GI complications in children? Vaccination lowers the risk of severe infection and subsequent complications, including GI issues. 5. When should I consult a healthcare provider about my child’s GI symptoms post-COVID-19? If symptoms persist beyond a few weeks or significantly impact your child’s daily activities, seek medical advice promptly.",

      "content": "Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are one of the most common health concerns for babies and young children. From the sniffles to serious hospital stays, RTIs can take a toll, not just on children, but on their families too. While medical care is always important, prevention is still the best first line of defense, especially for little ones. And one of the most powerful, natural ways to protect your baby? Breastfeeding . Why Are RTIs a Big Deal? Breastfeeding and RTIs: How Your Milk Shields Your Baby From Illness RTIs affect the nose, throat, airways, and lungs. They can range from mild colds to more serious conditions like bronchiolitis or pneumonia. For babies under 2 years old, these infections can lead to: Difficulty breathing High fevers Hospitalization Long-term respiratory issues Because a baby’s immune system is still developing, they’re especially vulnerable during their first year of life. The Invisible Shield: How Breastfeeding Helps Breastmilk isn’t just food. It’s a living substance packed with antibodies, white blood cells, and nutrients that help fight off viruses and bacteria. A recent study found that babies who were exclusively breastfed for 6 months and continued to be breastfed up to 1 year had: 34% lower risk of respiratory infections 59% lower risk of lower RTIs 88% lower risk of hospitalization due to RTIs Compared to formula-fed babies, the difference is significant. What Makes Breastmilk So Powerful? Breastfeeding and RTIs: How Your Milk Shields Your Baby From Illness Breastmilk contains: Immunoglobulin A (IgA) – creates a protective layer on mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and intestines White blood cells – directly fight off infections Prebiotics and probiotics – support a healthy gut, where much of the immune system lives Tailored antibodies – your body customizes these based on germs you’re exposed to, giving your baby hyper-local protection And the best part? The longer you breastfeed, the stronger and longer-lasting these benefits become. What If Breastfeeding Is Hard? Breastfeeding isn’t always smooth sailing. Some moms face low milk supply, latching issues, or physical exhaustion. If you’re struggling: Reach out to a lactation consultant Ask your pediatrician for guidance Lean on your support system Every drop of breastmilk still counts. Even a few weeks of breastfeeding can offer health benefits that last far beyond infancy. Protect What Matters Most As parents, we’d do anything to keep our children safe, and breastfeeding is one of the simplest yet most powerful ways to do that. It’s more than just nourishment; it’s your baby’s first line of defense against illness. Even a few weeks of breastfeeding can make a lasting difference. So if you can breastfeed, know that you’re giving your little one more than a meal. You’re giving your little one protection, comfort, and love straight from the heart.",

      "content": "Symptoms of being infected with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus are said to be similar to the common flu. However, experts have recently called itchy eyes a symptom of Omicron. Conjunctivitis or inflammation in the form of itchy and red eyes is said to be one of the symptoms of Omicron. According to experts, the virus that attacks the respiratory tract can also affect the sense of sight. “Some viruses that attack the respiratory tract can affect the eye area,” said infectious disease expert from the Johns Hopkins Center, Amesh A. Adalja, MD, quoted from CNBC , Thursday, January 27, 2022. American Academy of Ophthalmology said that conjunctivitis can show symptoms such as red, watery, itchy eyes and blurred vision. These complaints also occurred in previous COVID-19 viruses, so experts said it could possibly appear in COVID-19 symptoms Omicron. Dr Nina Aslam also expressed the same opinion. As quoted from Express , conjunctivitis or pink eye is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is the thin membrane that lines the inside of your eyelids. Dr Aslam said that Omicron’s symptoms can surprisingly cause conjunctivitis. A woman was found to have mild respiratory symptoms but showed severe conjunctivitis, and she tested positive for the coronavirus. Dr Aslam also explained how the COVID-19 virus can attack the eyes. “The cell receptors that the Covid variant uses to enter the body are in the eyes,” he said. Dr. Aslam added that previous studies have also suggested that Omicron may have a greater capacity to affect the eyes than other variants. Red eyes due to Omicron can appear even though the infected person does not experience symptoms of respiratory problems. If Red Eyes are Due to Omicron If you experience symptoms of red eyes, doctors recommend that you try to maintain eye hygiene. Clean eye discharge properly. “Wipe the eye crust using clean cotton dipped in cooled boiled water,” said Aslam. In cases of mild conjunctivitis infection, we can use certain eye drops or eye ointments as treatment. Main Symptoms of COVID-19 Omicron Common signs of Omicron according to ZOE Covid research include: Dry/itchy throat Have a cold Sneeze Mild muscle pain Fatigue In addition, there are other, less common signs, including brain fog, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, nausea or vomiting, with some people also experiencing difficulty sleeping and night sweats. Recently, a Berlin hospital revealed that fainting could be a symptom of COVID-19 infection Omicron. Meanwhile, the CDC said, there are symptoms that should immediately get medical help. Namely if it happens: skin and lips and nails become pale, where this symptom indicates very low oxygen levels in the blood. Omicron Case in Indonesia Quoting Kata Data, the development of COVID-19 cases of the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) in Indonesia has reached 1,665 cases as of Tuesday, January 25, 2022. The figure has a difference of 259 cases compared to the previous day. On a weekly basis, COVID-19 cases in Indonesia grew by 137.86 percent. With the number of Omicron variants, Indonesia is in first place in Southeast Asia. The country with the highest Omicron cases in Southeast Asia is still Singapore with 1,169 cases. Next is Thailand, which recorded 75.92 percent higher Omicron cases compared to last week. As for daily data, the number of Omicron cases in this country increased by 18.05 percent compared to yesterday. Then, Malaysia with the number of Omicron cases 463 cases (this number has not changed from the previous). The number of Omicron cases in Cambodia rose 38.26 percent to 159 cases, compared to the previous week and the number of Omicron cases in Vietnam rose 637.5 percent to 59 cases compared to the previous week. Meanwhile, the total number of Omicron COVID-19 cases worldwide reached 580.73 thousand cases. The number of COVID-19 variants increased compared to the previous week which amounted to 391.34 thousand cases. That’s the explanation of itchy eyes which are said to be one of the early signs of Omicron infection.

      "content": "What is Turner Syndrome? Turner syndrome is a rare genetic condition that only affects females. It occurs when one of the two X chromosomes that should be present in a female’s body is missing or does not function properly. The X chromosome is very important because it stores much of the genetic information needed for normal growth and development. Without a complete X chromosome , females with this disease may face several challenges in their physical and health aspects. What Are the Symptoms of Turner Syndrome? Symptoms vary depending on the individual, but some of the most common signs include: 1. Stunted Growth Children with the syndrome may be shorter than their peers. They will usually experience slower growth and will reach a lower adult height. 2. Certain Physical Characteristics Women with Turner Syndrome may have certain physical characteristics such as a short and wide neck, low-set ears, or a lower hairline at the back of the head. 3.Heart Defect Heart problems such as aortic stenosis (narrowing of the main blood vessel ) or other heart problems can occur. 4.Reproduction Problems Women who experience this problem often experience ovarian failure, which means they may not have periods or have difficulty getting pregnant. 5. Learning Problems Although most children with Turner Syndrome have a normal IQ, some may have difficulty with math and spatial skills. What Causes Turner Syndrome? The main cause is the loss or abnormality of the X chromosome that should be present in every cell of a female body. Every female has two X chromosomes, but in the case of Turner syndrome one of the X chromosomes is completely missing or partially non-functional. This happens randomly during the formation of an egg or sperm cell , and there is no specific reason that can cause this to happen. Risk Factors Turner syndrome is not something that is inherited from families, but is the result of genetic changes that occur by chance. Therefore, there are no specific risk factors that can increase a person’s chances of developing it. However, it is more likely to occur in individuals with older mothers, but again, this occurrence is very rare. Diagnosis and Treatment Doctors can usually diagnose Turner Syndrome based on the physical characteristics of the child. However, to confirm the diagnosis, several tests are needed. One of these is a blood test, where a small sample of blood is taken and examined to see if one X chromosome is missing. From there, the doctor will count the number of chromosomes in the blood cells and assess their shape and size. All of this is known as the “human phenotype.” In addition, other tests may be needed to check for other health problems, such as heart or kidney problems, which are often associated with Turner Syndrome. How Are Turner Syndrome Patients Treated? Treatment for Turner Syndrome usually involves hormone therapy, which aims to help the body readjust. Hormones are chemicals in the body that control growth and many other functions. For example, growth hormone can help increase growth rate, giving you the opportunity to add a few inches to your height. When entering puberty, female hormones will be given to stimulate physical development, such as breast growth and the start of menstruation. Additionally, if there are heart or kidney problems, certain medications may be needed. Specialists, including geneticists and endocrinologists , will work with the doctor to ensure the best treatment is chosen, to help the patient live a healthier life. mayo clinic , cleveland clinic Republished with permission from theAsianParent Malaysia",

      "content": "Some pregnant mothers may experience brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy. This is one of the symptoms that early pregnant mothers are quite worried about. Is there something wrong with their bodies? If pregnant women have brown vaginal discharge, will the fetus be okay? Today, TAP has compiled the causes, symptoms, and results of vaginal discharge turning brown in pregnant mothers. Let’s take a look. Why is vaginal discharge brown? For most women, having a change in the color of vaginal discharge is a cause for concern because it could be a sign that our body is trying to tell us. Let’s take a look at why vaginal discharge turns brown. 1. The beginning or end of the menstrual cycle. A woman’s menstruation is the blood flowing out of the vagina. Generally, there will be a lot or a little depending on the person. Normally, the brown discharge is caused by the reaction of the vagina to menstruation or the body’s natural vaginal cleansing. 2. Hormone deficiency Sometimes, brown discharge can be a sign of an imbalance of estrogen hormones, with too little estrogen flowing to the lining of the vagina. In addition to brown discharge, other symptoms may include: Feeling hot flashes cannot sleep Mood swings or depression No concentration Urinary tract infection Weight gain 3. Birth control pills Taking birth control pills or taking hormonal birth control pills may cause brown vaginal discharge during the first month of taking the pills. This includes irregular bleeding that may occur more often. If you take the birth control pills that contain less than 35 micrograms of estrogen, it can affect your menstrual period. And if you miss a period for too long, your body and the color of the vaginal discharge may change to a brown color. 4. Ovulation Normally, ovulation occurs in the middle of a woman’s menstrual cycle, which is when the egg moves out of the ovary to await fertilization with sperm. Therefore, each month, women are likely to have brown vaginal discharge due to the movement of the egg, and other symptoms such as lower abdominal pain and changes in body temperature. 5. Ovarian cysts Ovarian cysts, or polycystic ovaries, are fluid-filled sacs inside an ovary that can develop and enlarge. They can occur on one or both sides of your uterus, and can cause a variety of symptoms, including brown vaginal discharge and pelvic pain. 6. Medically-associated infections (STIs) Medically-related infections can cause brown vaginal discharge or vaginal bleeding. Some infections, such as gonorrhea or non-gonococcal urethritis, may not show symptoms in the early stages, but later on, there will be pain in the genitals while urinating, pelvic pain, and vaginal discharge that changes color, etc. If I have brown vaginal discharge, should I see a doctor? In many cases, the brown discharge may be old blood that the body has expelled from the uterus to cleanse the uterus, especially at the beginning and end of the menstrual cycle. But don’t forget to observe other symptoms if you feel any abnormalities in your body or you should see a doctor immediately if you feel that it is not discharge before or after your period because it may become a serious disease. You should see a doctor if you have the following symptoms along with brown discharge: Vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor or itching Lower abdominal pain or pain during intercourse Have a fever or other symptoms that are signs of infection. There is a large amount of vaginal discharge or there is fresh blood mixed in. Vaginal discharge lasts for more than 3 days. What causes brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy? The reason why pregnant women have brown discharge, especially early pregnancy mothers, if they have brown discharge, it is usually due to irritation, increased hormones, and increased blood flow during pregnancy, which makes the cervix very fragile. Or having sex during pregnancy and a pelvic exam that may be harsh can also cause brown discharge. In addition, finding brown discharge during pregnancy near the end of pregnancy is a warning sign that the mother is about to give birth, no more than 2-3 weeks away, or some mothers may have it 2-3 days before the baby is born. In addition, mothers who are about to give birth may have symptoms such as bleeding from the vagina or blood mixed with the discharge. However, if you are not sure about the bleeding, consult a specialist immediately. Causes of brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy Pregnancy causes many changes in the body of a mother, including the occurrence of brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy. This is due to the change in pH in the female genital area, which may cause a small amount of vaginal discharge and is not a cause for much concern. The occurrence of brown vaginal discharge may occur for 2-3 days and then disappears naturally. Therefore, it is considered normal for pregnant women. Sometimes, there may be a little blood mixed in. This may be caused by the mother’s physical activities, such as exercising, carrying heavy objects, cleaning the house too hard, or having sex. However, if you find that the discharge smells bad or feel a burning or itchy sensation in the vagina, it may be a symptom indicating a serious change, including: Infection: Because pregnant women are at higher risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases than normal women. Risk of miscarriage. Most often, the risk of miscarriage occurs when the fetus is about 10 weeks old. Symptoms will occur suddenly and include a brown or red discharge from the vagina. Other symptoms include cramps or pain in the lower abdomen, blood clots in the vagina, dizziness, or fainting. An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilized egg implants in a fallopian tube or into an ovary, abdomen, or cervix. This is called an ectopic pregnancy. In addition to brown discharge, an ectopic pregnancy may cause other symptoms, including sudden pain in the abdomen, pelvis, neck, and shoulders, pelvic pain on one side of the body, dizziness, or fainting. Cervical infection : When the cervix becomes inflamed for whatever reason, such as a bacterial infection, an allergy to feminine hygiene products, or a hormonal imbalance, pregnant women may experience the following symptoms: a large amount of vaginal discharge, which may have an odor, lower abdominal pain, vaginal pain, back pain, or pain while urinating. If you notice a change in the color of your vaginal discharge, or if you experience severe cramps in your abdomen, rapid uterine contractions, or severe back pain, see a doctor immediately. What to do if you find brown vaginal discharge during pregnancy? If you notice brown discharge after sex, it is considered normal. Therefore, you may wear a sanitary pad for 1-2 days after sex to prevent staining your underwear. However, if your discharge changes to brown or contains blood after sex more than 2-3 times a month or more than 2 weeks, including the discharge has a strong odor and is accompanied by cramps, see a doctor immediately. Because these symptoms are signs of infection or other more serious symptoms. Initially, the doctor may do an ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis to make sure that the fetus is developing normally and does not have an infection. If the fetus is found to be healthy, the doctor may treat it with antibiotics or other medications to eliminate the vaginal infection. And you should closely monitor your symptoms and abstain from sex during this time. Let’s listen to what the doctor has to say!

If the pain is not severe or the symptoms only last for a short time, just change your position or get up to go to the bathroom and it goes away, then it is not a symptom to worry about. But if you feel severe abdominal pain, pregnant mothers must see a doctor immediately. Pregnant woman, pain in the left side of the abdomen, which organs are involved? Left abdominal pain during pregnancy can be related to multiple organs in the abdomen. Pregnant mothers should note the location of the pain (upper or lower abdomen) to help identify the cause of the pain, as this area contains several important organs. If you have pain, see a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment. The left abdomen can be divided into two main parts: Upper left abdomen: Contains organs such as the stomach, pancreas, spleen, and left kidney. Lower left abdomen: Contains organs such as the uterus, left ovary, ureter, small intestine, and large intestine.

Pain in the lower left abdomen and pain in the right side of the uterus may be caused by a tilted uterus. When pregnant women feel pain in their abdomen on the left side, it may be because your uterus is tilted to the right, causing the ligaments that hold the uterus on the left side to tighten. Mothers therefore feel pain from time to time, and the pain will be worse when they laugh or move quickly. Sometimes this symptom will spread to the groin area. To relieve this pain, mothers may have to fix it by moving slowly or consulting a doctor to find a way to help relieve the pain from the doctor. 2. Pain in the left abdominal cavity, pain in the lower left abdominal cavity, pregnant women have pain in the lower left abdominal cavity, stabbing pain that comes and goes, ovarian cysts or ovarian cysts. If you feel pain in the lower left abdomen, which is the location of your ovaries, you may have an ovarian cyst. The reason is that during pregnancy, the ovarian cyst continues to produce a group of tissue called the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone and estrogen. Ovarian cysts occur from the accumulation of fluid in the corpus luteum. In some cases, it can go away on its own without treatment. In some cases, if the cyst continues to grow larger, it can cause problems later. In the case of pregnant women, if the cyst is hidden behind the uterus, it may be difficult to detect. And if this ovarian cyst continues to grow larger, it may be difficult for you to give birth because the cyst blocks the birth canal. Symptoms of ovarian cysts are as follows: stomach ache Left abdominal pain I have pain in my left abdomen, it is sharp and comes and goes. Pain in the left abdomen radiating to the back Frequent urination Lower abdominal pain and back pain Abnormal bleeding 3. Pain in the lower left abdomen, digestive system During pregnancy, the body’s hormones are constantly changing. Sometimes, it can affect the digestive system, causing gas in the stomach and constipation, which may be one of the reasons why you feel pain in the left side of your stomach. However, pain in the left side of the abdomen is not only caused by pregnancy. It may also occur due to physical illnesses such as pancreatitis or gallstones. Pancreatitis causes pain in the middle of the abdomen or more to the left side, and symptoms usually appear after the mother eats very greasy foods or when lying on her back. 4.

Lower left abdominal pain Ectopic pregnancy is another cause of pain in the left side of the abdomen. This symptom will not appear in the first weeks of pregnancy. The cause of ectopic pregnancy is the implantation of the fertilized egg outside the uterus. It usually implants in the fallopian tube. If the embryo is allowed to grow until the fallopian tube ruptures, the mother will be at risk of bleeding and may lead to death. Most doctors will terminate the pregnancy to save the mother’s life. Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy include the following: Pain in the abdomen or lower abdomen that is a squeezing sensation that comes and goes. There is pain radiating to the shoulder and chest pain.

Pregnant woman has pain in lower left abdomen, sharp pain A stabbing or dull pain in the lower abdomen, similar to menstrual pain, that occurs without vaginal bleeding is a common symptom during the 4th to 5th month of pregnancy.

There is a significant increase in vaginal discharge. Unusual back pain Cramping pains similar to severe menstrual cramps A feeling of pressure in the lower abdomen or pelvis. Pain in the upper abdomen under the ribs Pain under the ribs often occurs in pregnant women towards the end of pregnancy because the baby has grown a lot and pushed the uterus up to the area below the ribs.

      "content": "Many mothers give importance to fulfilling all aspects of their babies’ potential from the womb, especially the “brain”, an important organ that is the foundation of intelligence, creativity, and potential in all aspects of life. Amidst the many beliefs and recommendations about pregnancy food, the question on many mothers’ minds is “What do pregnant women eat to make their babies smart?” or “Is there really the best food for brain development in the fetus?” While some pregnant mothers may be concerned about their own food and nutrition during pregnancy because what the mother eats will be passed on to the fetus. Today, let’s see what kind of food helps make babies smart. What do pregnant women eat to make their babies smart? If you’re ready, let’s take a look. What nutrients are there to nourish the brain of a baby in the womb? During pregnancy, your body needs additional nutrients to support your baby’s growth and development. Your baby’s brain starts developing from the early stages of pregnancy, so getting the right nutrients is crucial for your baby’s healthy brain development. Important nutrients that nourish your baby’s brain Folate : Plays a key role in the formation of a baby’s neural tube, reduces the risk of birth defects in the brain and spinal cord, and promotes overall brain health. Found in green leafy vegetables, soybeans, liver, egg yolks, and citrus fruits. Omega-3 fatty acids : are important components of brain and retinal cells, aiding in brain development, learning and memory in infants. Found in salmon, tuna, mackerel, flaxseeds and walnuts. Omega-3 fatty acids Iodine : Essential for the development of the baby’s brain and nervous system. If the mother does not get enough iodine, it may affect the child’s intellectual development. Found in sea salt, tuna, milk and eggs. Iron : Found in meat, soybeans, green leafy vegetables and grains, it helps in the production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the brain and other parts of the baby’s body. A lack of iron can affect brain development. Zinc : Found in meat, peanuts, oats, and pumpkin seeds, zinc is important for brain development and immune system function. Choline : Found in egg yolks, liver, salmon, soybeans and milk, it is essential for brain and nervous system development and helps create neurotransmitters important for memory and learning. Normally, pregnant women should eat foods that contain 200 milligrams of omega-3 per day. Omega-3 can be found in freshwater fish and seafood. In addition, mothers should eat foods such as nuts, sunflower seeds, rice bran oil or corn oil to get omega-6 and should eat them together with foods that contain vitamin D and vitamin E. What should pregnant women eat to make their babies smart? 12 types of brain-boosting foods that pregnant mothers should eat Who wouldn’t want their child to be smart? Let’s take a look at 12 foods that help promote brain function in unborn babies. 1. Salmon fillet For moms who like to eat salmon , congratulations. Salmon has a very high level of omega 3 and also has iodine, which is beneficial to the body and thyroid glands of moms. If you don’t like salmon, you can eat other types of fish such as tuna, mackerel, snakehead fish, swai fish, canned fish of the mackerel family , bonito , catfish, king mackerel , gourami, sardines, tilapia, eel, etc. It is recommended to eat fish 2-3 times a week, alternating with seafood such as shrimp, shellfish or squid. And you should only eat these types of fish or food that is cooked. Pregnant women should definitely not eat raw food. 2. Green leafy vegetables Green leafy vegetables are another type of food that helps children develop good learning skills. They contain folic acid, which helps protect the baby’s brain from being easily damaged, and also helps reduce the risk of cleft lip and palate. 3. Berry Berries such as blueberries , strawberries and mulberries are rich in antioxidants, vitamin C and folic acid which help improve the functioning of the baby’s brain, helping the baby to be born with a healthy and intelligent brain, and also help the mother ’s skin glow . 4. Eggs Eggs are high in protein and low in calories, especially hard-boiled eggs. They also contain an amino acid called choline, which some research suggests can help develop children’s brains and improve their memory. 5. Cheese Cheese provides vitamin D, which is good for the body. It helps the baby’s brain to function better. Plus, vitamin D is considered a nutrient that pregnant women should consume every day to help the body function normally. 6. Greek yogurt Snacks like Greek yogurt contain protein that helps boost memory and helps build brain cells in the baby in the womb. It also contains calcium, which helps strengthen bones and teeth. 7. Almonds Almonds contain healthy fats and omega-3 fatty acids that help stimulate brain function. Pregnant mothers can eat almonds every day to help enhance the baby’s brain development. Or, you can eat peanuts instead, which is just as beneficial. 8. Pumpkin seeds Pumpkin seeds contain zinc, a mineral that helps promote brain function and helps children become smart and alert. Pumpkin seeds also contain antioxidants that are good for mothers. 9. Beans Nuts are another food and snack that mothers should not overlook. They provide nutrients that are good for the body, such as iron and vitamin E, which help the body transport oxygen to the baby’s nerve cells, making the baby’s brain work more efficiently. 10. Vitamin supplements Currently, there are vitamin supplements available at drug stores nationwide. There are both separate vitamin supplements and combined vitamin supplements available for purchase. If you are worried that you are not getting enough essential nutrients and would like to take vitamin supplements, you can consult your doctor before buying vitamins to take. 11. Unbleached flour Carbohydrates are nutrients that pregnant women should receive every day. Brown rice, unpolished rice, and whole wheat bread are foods that provide energy to the mother’s body and help develop the baby’s brain in the womb. 12. Milk In addition to milk containing calcium that helps strengthen the bones and teeth of both mother and child, it also contains iron that helps develop the baby’s brain. Mothers should only drink pasteurized milk. There are many types of milk that pregnant women can drink, such as cow’s milk, goat’s milk, soy milk, almond milk, rice milk, etc. Dietary advice: What should you eat if you want your child to be smart? Now that you know what foods can make your child smart, let’s see how to eat them safely and even better for your body. If you are worried that you are not getting enough nutrients, you can take vitamin supplements. However, you must consult your doctor first. You should not buy and take them yourself. When choosing fish, choose from clean, safe sources and avoid eating fish that are highly contaminated with mercury. Eat a variety of vegetables and fruits. Mothers do not have to eat only berries. And every time before eating, wash the fruits thoroughly. Choose fresh, clean vegetables that are free of mold or rotten appearances, and wash them thoroughly before cooking every time. Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages and, if possible, avoid drinking tea or coffee, as these beverages can damage a child’s brain and memory. Eat healthy snacks to boost your protein intake. This could be yogurt smoothies, nut soup, or peanut butter and crackers. Take care not to let your body lack iron because iron helps transport oxygen to the baby in the womb. If the baby’s body lacks oxygen for a long time, the baby may be born with a low IQ. Always control your weight, but do not fast. If you are overweight, it may cause other health problems in the future. During pregnancy, what to do to make your baby smart? Taking care of yourself and creating the right environment during pregnancy is crucial to your baby’s brain development. In addition to eating healthy foods, there are other factors that mothers can do to help their babies become smart even while they are still in the womb, as follows: 1. Balanced and complete nutrition , focusing on important nutrients such as Omega 3 (DHA), folate, choline, iron, and iodine. 2. Taking vitamins and supplements as advised by your doctor. Prenatal vitamins often contain folate and other important nutrients that contribute to brain development and prevent neurological disorders. Consult your doctor for advice on the right vitamins and supplements. 3. Get enough rest. Quality sleep is important for the health of the mother and the development of the fetus. It allows the body and brain to rest and recover. 4. Stress management: Stress during pregnancy can affect the baby’s brain development. Take time to relax and do something you enjoy, such as reading, listening to soft music, practicing breathing exercises , or meditating. 5. Regular light exercise. Proper and safe exercise for pregnant women helps improve blood circulation, which is good for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Consult a doctor before starting exercise. 6. Talking and interacting with your baby in the womb. Even though your baby is still in the womb, he or she can hear sounds from outside. Talking, reading stories, or singing to your baby stimulates language and perception development. 7. Musical stimulation: Listening to soft instrumental music or classical music can help stimulate the baby’s brain. 8. Overall health care: Avoid smoking, drinking alcohol and drugs, as these have a serious impact on the baby’s brain development. Also, avoid harmful chemicals and pollution. 9. Attending prenatal care and health check-ups as scheduled. Closely monitoring your prenatal health with your doctor allows you to monitor your baby’s development and deal with any problems that may arise in a timely manner. 10. Bonding with your baby. Rubbing your belly, touching and responding to your baby’s movements creates an emotional bond that has a positive effect on your baby’s long-term brain and mental development. How is it? Now you probably know what kind of food helps your baby be smart. If you are going to eat it, don’t forget to buy it from a clean and safe source. Also, you should always consult your doctor before eating any kind of food so that the doctor can help plan your nutrition and ensure the safety of you and your baby in the womb. parents , parents , medicalnewstoday , sanook , โรงพยาบาลศิครินทร์ , คณะแพทยศาสตร์ศิริราชพยาบาล , swimmingkidsthailand Republished with permission from theAsianParent Thailand",

      "content": "Can pregnant women with toothaches take painkillers like everyone else before seeing a dentist? And if they do, will painkillers affect the baby in the womb? When many people feel toothache, the first thing they think of is to take painkillers such as paracetamol or aspirin to relieve the symptoms first. But what about pregnant women? Is it possible to take these medications? What should pregnant women do if they have toothaches? What medicines can pregnant women take if they have wisdom teeth, swollen gums, or molars? Let’s find out. Tooth sensitivity during pregnancy During pregnancy, you will experience many discomforts. Your body will change, so you may experience back pain or discomfort. However, while you are trying to prop yourself up with a high pillow to sleep better, you may notice that another source of discomfort for pregnant women is your teeth. You may experience sensitive teeth during pregnancy, but if you know that other pregnant women experience the same symptoms, you may feel relieved. Here are some of the reasons why pregnant women may experience sensitive teeth and sore gums, and how to deal with these symptoms safely. Reasons why pregnant women have toothaches. Relieve toothaches in 1 minute. During pregnancy, from the 2nd month onwards, there will be more blood vessels feeding the gums than usual. This makes it easy for pregnant women to have gingivitis and it is more likely to be inflamed than usual. Pregnant women can have gum disease ranging from simple gingivitis to periodontitis or gingivitis, which is inflammation of the gums along with inflammation of the periodontal ligament, root coating, and alveolar bone. The reason why pregnant women have toothaches and tooth decay may be due to eating habits that are more frequent during pregnancy, which causes food particles to stick to the teeth. If you don’t brush your teeth every time after eating, it will make it easier for mothers to have tooth decay and toothache. 1. High progesterone hormone When a new mother is pregnant, hormonal changes in the body can cause gum inflammation and easy bleeding, making it impossible for the mother to brush her teeth properly because she will feel pain in her mouth. What inevitably follows is toothache. 2. Eat often Expectant mothers tend to eat more frequently than normal people, which causes food particles to get stuck between their teeth. Especially if they don’t brush their teeth after every meal, and some may already have pain due to the first reason, toothache and tooth decay are not difficult to find. 3. Stomach acid People who experience morning sickness and vomiting will also have stomach acid coming out. This acid will erode the teeth, causing tooth decay. Finally, there will be a lot of bacteria in the mouth, which can also pass on germs to the baby in the womb. Is it true that pregnant women get tooth decay because their baby takes away calcium ? The belief or rumour that pregnant mothers will have toothache, toothache, and tooth decay because the baby in the womb draws calcium from the mother, the truth is that calcium from the mother’s teeth cannot dissolve into the bloodstream to build the baby’s bones and teeth. If there is a high demand for calcium, the baby will draw calcium from the mother’s bones to use first. How to relieve toothache for expecting mothers? How to relieve toothache in 1 minute 1. Hot compress Apply a towel soaked in warm water or a hot water bottle to the painful cheek area. Be careful not to get it near the eye area, as this can cause injury. 2. Apply cold compress. Whenever you feel throbbing pain and swollen gums, apply ice for about 5 minutes. Repeat this every half hour and the symptoms will gradually ease. 3. Rinse your mouth with salt water. Mix about 1 teaspoon of salt with about 1 cup of boiled water. Stir until dissolved. Then gargle for about half a minute before spitting it out. The salt will help relieve swollen gums. 4. Acupressure You may try gently massaging the cheek above the aching tooth or using a small ice cube to press on the painful area, which will also help relieve the symptoms. Some people solve the problem by soaking their feet in warm water, some people have their father massage them to relieve the pain, and some people use Thai massage services, depending on what is more convenient for them. 5. Eat vegetables to relieve pain. Dental food: Morning glory, which we all know helps with eyesight, can also help relieve toothache. Just pound the morning glory roots until fine, squeeze out the juice, and mix with vinegar. Then hold it in your mouth for about 5 minutes, then spit it out. Or bitter melon, a vegetable that seems very bitter but has many more properties, can also help with this problem. Pound the bitter melon roots until fine, then put them into the aching tooth. Press it with your tongue for a while, then spit it out. You will gradually feel better. It is called “Sweet is faint, bitter is medicine”. The real deal, the real voice. And we may have heard that rinsing your mouth with salt water frequently can reduce toothache. But if you rinsing too frequently, you may get negative effects from the salt mixed with water instead. Because salt contains high sodium, which is not good for your health. Therefore, we recommend that you try boiling coriander seeds with water and rinsing your mouth frequently. Don’t be afraid that you will get too much sodium. It also relieves toothache. In addition, a helper that many people know about is aloe vera, a universal herb that can treat a variety of symptoms. It not only helps heal wounds or cool down, but it can also kill germs and break down the toxins of germs. Therefore, it is not strange that it is used to treat toothache due to tooth decay. Simply wash off all the latex from aloe vera, cut it into small pieces, and place it between the aching teeth. Or, you can take a cotton swab and dip it in aloe vera gel and apply it to the aching area to temporarily relieve the pain. 6. Try not to take painkillers. Mothers must be very careful about this. If you don’t feel the pain is too much or you can still tolerate it, you should avoid taking any type of medication, especially during the first 8-10 weeks of pregnancy because this is the period when the baby’s brain, lungs, and heart are developing. Taking certain types of medication can cause the baby’s organs to develop abnormally. However, you should always consult a doctor if you have to take any type of medication. Pregnant women with toothaches take paracetamol and toothache medicine. How does this affect the baby? If a mother takes more than the recommended amount of paracetamol, the excessive amount of paracetamol can cause side effects to the fetus, such as: Infants are 30% more likely to have attention deficit disorder and autism than children who were not given medication while pregnant. Infants are about 29% more likely to develop asthma as they age than infants who did not receive medication in the womb. How does a pregnant woman’s tooth decay affect her baby in the womb? Premature birth Oral infections such as gingivitis or untreated tooth decay can cause inflammation that affects the hormones that regulate birth, increasing the risk of preterm birth. Low birth weight. An infection in your mother’s mouth can cause your baby to be underweight, which can affect your baby’s development after birth. Transmission of germs: Bacteria that are caused by tooth decay can spread into the mother’s bloodstream and affect the baby’s immune system. Pregnant women have tooth decay. What should they do? How should they take care of themselves to keep their baby safe? What do pregnant women do to prevent tooth decay? Before tooth decay becomes a chronic problem affecting both the mother and the little member about to be born, all mothers should prevent this disease by brushing their teeth regularly every day, morning and before bed (or if possible, brush after 3 meals). You should brush for 2 minutes each time. Use dental floss to help in areas where a toothbrush cannot reach. Choose a toothpaste that contains fluoride because fluoride helps prevent tooth enamel decay and increases the tooth enamel’s resistance to acid. In addition, mothers should not eat food that is too hard, including food that is very hot or very cold because it will cause the loss of tooth enamel. And should inform the dentist about the toothache in the most detail so that treatment can be given early and will help reduce the possible dangers. However, the best way to treat toothache is to prevent it from happening by taking care of your mouth and teeth to be clean and good at all times, such as brushing your teeth at least twice a day, flossing to remove food particles and plaque, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular dental checkups for good oral health. konthong Republished with permission from theAsianParent Thailand",
